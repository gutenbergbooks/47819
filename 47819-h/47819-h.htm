<h3>NUMBER FIVE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was as beautiful an evening as a lover could ask, the second
day of April, 1842, that I bade my friend Dana good-bye, and started
in my sulky for a tour over the land of Nullification. I left Charleston
in the evening, that the wearisome task of crossing the river
might be over, and the earlier start upon my journey be made the
following morning. Tarrying at the house of a fine old planter
during the night, who amused me until nearly cock-crowing with his
long stories of revolutionary days, I arose, after a very slight
refreshment from sleep, and was on my way toward Georgetown
an hour before sunrise. It was a toilsome way enough, the road
running parallel with the sea-shore the whole distance of sixty miles,
just far enough inland never to catch a glimpse of the water, and
leading you over a dreary pine barren, where neither house, cultivated
field, nor flowing streamlet occurred to divert your attention
for the whole day. It was pleasant enough at first to feel one's self
alone in those boundless forests of pine; and for an hour or two of
the early morning I was sufficiently amused by the novel sight of
some young alligator splashing into the water from the road-side, as
the noise of my wheels awoke him from his siesta, or of a huge
moccasin darting away beneath the dense reeds and lily-pads of
the swamp, or of the ever-varying, myriad-toned music of the mocking
birds who filled the air with their melody. But by degrees, as
the sun began to rise above the trees, and the heavens to assume
that brazen face which characterizes a southern sky, the never-changing
scenery about me grew dull and wearisome, and I found
myself looking forward in the hope of finding some place by the
roadside where my horse might slake his thirst. No such place,
however, appeared; on and onward we jogged over that apparently
unending level of creaking sand, without one sign of human
industry or human life. As matters began to grow serious, and my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
weary steed to manifest symptoms of dissatisfaction which could
not be mistaken, a kind Providence sent a fellow-being along my
path, in the shape of the most hideous, tattered, and wo-begone
negro I had ever seen&mdash;my first specimen of a plantation servant.
The poor fellow's face and garments, however, sadly belied him; for
upon my salutation of 'Boy, good morning; can you tell me
where I can find water for my horse?' he touched his rimless hat
and most civilly replied:</p>

<p>'Oh, yes, Massa! dere is fine water just back ob you!'</p>

<p>'Back of me?' I replied. 'Strange I did not see it!' and turning
my horse to retrace the path, the negro discovered my greenness,
and laughing, said:</p>

<p>'Why, Massa, you 'ab no bucket to water de horse!'</p>

<p>'Bucket?' I inquired in astonishment! 'Bucket? What do
you mean, boy? What <em>do</em> you mean?'</p>

<p>The poor fellow could scarcely contain his gravity, while he
replied, pointing to the bottom of the sulky: 'Sure, Massa 'ab no
bucket! Massa no bin long in Carolina to tink water he horse widout
bucket! Every body hab bucket on he carriage in Carolina!'</p>

<p>Here was indeed a perplexity of which I had never dreamed,
and to extricate myself from which more than surpassed my share
of even Yankee shrewdness. I could not think of driving fourteen
long miles back to my morning resting-place in the heat of that torrid
sun, nor of going forward the twelve miles to my first stopping place
on the Georgetown road; and yet, from all the information I could
gain from the negro, these seemed the only conditions upon which
horse or driver were ever again to meet with the proprieties of civilized
existence. In utter despair I looked up to my informer, with
a respect I had never bestowed upon tattered garments before, and
asked: 'Boy, what <em>am</em> I to do?'</p>

<p>'Don' know, Massa! Neber see a carriage wid'out bucket afore!
Don' know, Massa!'</p>

<p>Though my informant had hitherto evidently been greatly
amused at my perplexity, the despair of my countenance, or his
pity for the jaded beast, now awakened his sympathies; and after
scratching his head&mdash;a manipulation which the negro invariably
performs when he is in trouble&mdash;he suddenly rolled the whites of
his great eyes up to me and said with quickness, 'Me tink now,
Massa! Me tink how Massa water he horse!' and plunging into
the woods, presently returned with his <em>hat</em> filled with water. It
was a capital thought, and the promptitude of its execution would
have done honor to a Connecticut pedler. My dilemma was over;
the negro's hat of water was a goblet of ambrosia to my steed; and
the tattered son of Ham became in my eyes fair as a messenger of
the gods.</p>

<p>Between the Ashly and Santee rivers, a distance of more than
thirty miles, there are upon the main thoroughfare but three dwelling-houses.
Upon the banks of the latter, one begins first to see
something of the wealth of the Carolina rice-plantations. For
many miles up and down the North and South Santee rivers, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
are here separated but a single mile, are cultivated those deep, rich
bottoms, annually flowed and inexhaustible in resource, which are
the glory of the State. The lordly owners of these manors pass
the winter months in superintending the affairs of the homesteads,
gathering about them all those luxuries which minister to ease and
pleasure, of which none better understand the value, or select with
more taste, than do these descendants of king Charles's cavaliers,
and entering with a zeal and alacrity into those rural sports which
are the zest and glory of a southern country life. Finer horsemen,
more skilled marksmen, on the plain or in the forest, hardier frames
for pugilistic feats, or a quicker eye and prompter hand for a game
at fence, the world cannot produce. They are generally men also
of liberal learning and generous dispositions; frank, hospitable, and
courteous; and, bating a tithe of that hot-blood chivalry upon which
they are too apt to pride themselves, noble and humane in all their
impulses.</p>

<p>One marks every where at the South the eminently kind relations
which exist between master and servant. To every man born and
bred upon the plantation, the negro seems essential, in a thousand
respects with which a northerner can have no sympathy. I saw
nothing of what we call prejudice against color in all my travels.
In infancy the same nurse gives food and rest to her own child and
to her master's; in childhood the same eye watches and the same
hand alternately caresses and corrects them; they mingle their sports
in boyhood; and through youth up to manhood there are ties which
link them to each other by an affinity that no time or circumstances
can destroy. An illiterate, rough planter, who was by no means
remarkable for the kindness he showed his servants, said to me one
day: 'I travelled last summer all over Iowa territory, and I didn't
see a nigger in two months. To be sure I felt kind o' badly, but it
couldn't be helped; so I made the best of it, thinking all the time I
should be home again bye and bye. Well, Sir, I got back again as
far as Zanesville in 'Hio, where there was a gineral muster and a
heap of people; and pretty soon I heard a banjo; thinks I, there's
some of <em>our folks</em>, I know; and sure enough there was two niggers
and a wench going it powerful; and the way I went up to 'em and
got hold of their hands, and says I, 'How are you, my good fellows?
how are you, girl?' and the way I shook and they shook, was a caution
to abolitionists, I tell you?'</p>

<p>Georgetown <em>District</em> is the wealthiest portion of the State; but a
more miserable collection of decayed wood domicils and filthy beer
shops than are clustered together to make up the <em>town</em>, it would be
difficult to find. Indeed, unlike the free States, the wealth of the
South lies almost entirely in the country; the towns, unless Charleston
form an exception, being made up of artizans and traders. The
historical associations of Georgetown District are of great interest;
and many of the localities, rendered famous by feats of valor during
the war of our Revolution, are still pointed out. An old soldier,
whom I met by accident at the ferry-house on the banks of the
Pedee, conducted me to the spot where General Marion invited the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
British officer to dinner&mdash;a scene immortalized by the pencil of
White. Marion had long contended against the enemies of his
country at fearful odds, and though the poverty and daily diminution
of his troops were not known to the British, yet to himself, through
the whole of the first campaign in South Carolina, they were
sources of great disquietude and alarm. He managed, however,
by celerity of movement and a perfect knowledge of the country to
keep the enemy's forces in constant fear, and now and then to
obtain over detached bodies of troops a signal victory. It was after
one of these sudden dashes upon a foraging party whom the British
colonel had sent into the country, in which Marion had been even
more successful than usual, that an officer was sent to his camp
with a flag of truce to propose an exchange of prisoners. Marion
received him in the woods, negotiated the terms upon which the
exchange should be made, passed the writings necessary for the
purpose, and, after concluding all the preliminaries, invited the
officer to dine with him. The invitation was accepted, and Marion,
leading the way still farther into the forest, took his seat upon a
log near which a watch-fire was burning, and invited the officer to
do the same. Presently a negro appeared, and, raking open the
ashes, uncovered a batch of roasted potatoes, which he presented
upon a board, first to the stranger, and then to his master. No
apologies were offered for the meagre fare, and after the dinner was
over, the officer departed with his flag. It is said that upon regaining
his own lines, he forthwith threw up his commission, on the
ground that it was hopeless to contend with an enemy who
required no shelter but that of the forest trees, and no food but
roasted potatoes.</p>

<p>As you advance inland from Georgetown, and begin to enter the
cotton country, the scenery is completely changed. The huge live
oaks, draperied with moss, the peculiar characteristic of the sickly lowlands,
all disappear, and with them depart nearly all the evidences
of wealth or taste or refinement. Instead of princely mansions surrounded
by old parks and highly cultivated plantations, one sees
nothing but low, piazza'd domicils, in fields bare of vegetation, and
the appendage of miserable hovels scattered at short distances here
and there for the field-hands. In the low country the rank growth
upon the marshes affords some compensation for the want of green
fields of grass; but in the up country every shade of greenness is
lost in the interminable red clay-fields which spread out every
where around you. It was new to me that the upland grasses could
not be cultivated below Virginia, but so it is. Every where, by the
road side, in the court-yard, over the fenced fields, and in the forest,
the bosom of mother earth is bared before you; and to one accustomed
to the green mantle with which she robes herself in New
England, the sight is almost shocking. Equally so was another
sight, with which, however, I soon became familiar, but which at
the outset startled my sense of decency to a degree; I refer to the
nudity of the young negroes. Up to ten and eleven years of age, the
colored children of both sexes run about entirely naked; and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
more secluded plantations they may be seen at even a later age,
without a fig-leaf of covering to their jetty limbs. I beg my friends,
the abolitionists, will not set this down as a new instance of the
cruelty of the masters, as I had repeated and indubitable evidence
of its being a habit of such determinate choice upon the part of the
children, as to defy every effort to break it up. That it manifests
the state of utter degradation to which the slaves are reduced, I do
not deny; for every where, in lowland and highland, country and
city, nothing is more evident than the mental and moral degradation
of the negro.</p>

<p>As the value of the lands and the wealth of the inhabitants
decrease, while you journey toward the back country, so also does
the intelligence of the people. I never met in my whole life with
so many white persons who could neither read nor write, who had
never taken a newspaper, who had never travelled fifty miles from
home, or who had never been to the house of God, or heard a sentence
read from his Holy Word, as I found in a single season in South
Carolina. Like the inhabitants of Nineveh, many of them could
not discern between the right hand and the left. What wonder
then that the hosts of Yankee pedlers, until driven out by the sumptuary
laws, fattened upon the land! 'What do you think I gave for
that?' asked an ignorant planter in Sumpter district, while pointing
to a Connecticut wooden clock which stood upon a shelf in the corner
of the room. 'I don't know,' was my answer; 'twenty dollars, or
very likely twenty-five!' '<em>Twenty-five dollars</em>, stranger!' replied
the planter; 'why, what do you mean? Come, guess fair, and I'll
tell you <em>true</em>!' I answered again, that twenty-five dollars was a
high price for such a clock, as I had often seen them sold for a quarter
of that sum. The man was astonished. 'Stranger,' said he, 'I
gave one hundred and forty-four dollars for that clock, and thought I
got it cheap at that! Let me tell you how it was. We had always
used sundials hereabout, till twelve or fourteen years ago, when a
man came along with clocks to sell. I thought at first I wouldn't
buy one, but after haggling about the price for a while, he agreed to
take sixteen dollars less than what he asked, for his selling price
was one hundred and sixty dollars; and as I had just sold my cotton
at thirty-four cents, I concluded to strike the bargain. It's a powerful
clock, but I reckon I gave a heap of money for it!'</p>

<p>In fact, during those years when the staples of Carolina sold for
nearly thrice their intrinsic value, and wealth flowed in an uninterrupted
stream through every channel of industry, the plantations of
the South became the legitimate plunder of Yankee shrewdness.
It was no meeting of Greek with Greek in the contest of wits, but
a perfect inrush of shrewd, disciplined tacticians in the art of
knavery, upon a stupid and ignorant population. The whole country
was flooded with itinerant hawkers. There is scarcely an article
in the whole range of home manufactures upon which fortunes
were not made during those times of inflated prices of the southern
staple products. Through the mountain passes of Buncombe county
there flowed a stream of pedlers' carts, wagons, carry-alls, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
arks, which inundated the land. Indeed, so great at length became
the evil, and so overmatched in the contest of wits were the planters
of the uplands, that the legislature passed laws forbidding a
Yankee pedler to enter the State.</p>

<p>It is this deplorable ignorance, which is prevalent over a large
portion of South Carolina, that constitutes the most insuperable
obstacle to the removal of slavery. Among the more wealthy and
intelligent of the population, juster sentiments prevail in regard to
that great evil; but their opinions and wishes are greatly overbalanced
by the masses of the middling classes. They, wedded to
the customs of their fathers beyond all hope of improvement; vegetators
upon the soil cleared and prepared by their ancestors; ignorant,
idle, and overbearing; driven by thriftless modes of agriculture,
and the impoverishing system of slave-labor, to penurious economy,
and scouting every suggestion of manual toil as servile and degrading;
<em>they</em> compose the great barrier around the institution of negro
servitude, which the tide of public sentiment never reaches, and
which the advancing intelligence of other portions of the world
cannot soon affect. To them, hedged in by the antiquated prejudices
of a barbarous age, alike unfitted to know and unwilling to
receive the new truths of humanity and religion, the negro seems
the connecting link between man and the brute. Of their own
origin and destiny they know and care little; of him who toils for
them, less; and it is vain to hope, until the States between them
and the free people of the North shall have broken down the system
which curses alike the owner and his soil, that the intelligence of an
independent and virtuous people can ever reach them.</p>

<p>In these Sketches, which are now brought to a close, I have
endeavored to represent the condition of South Carolina as I saw it.
Of slavery I have said what I believe, and of its white population
what I know to be true. There, as elsewhere in a world tainted by
evil, injustice too often embitters the cup of life. But it is not the
slave only, bending to his irksome task, nor he who toils under the
heat of a southern sky alone, who drains it to its dregs. The chalice
is commended to the lips every where. And deeply has the writer
drank, from the hands of those who profess to be guided by the
divine precepts of Christ, banded as they were to subvert oppression
and wrong in southern institutions, a draft of injustice more poisonous
than the bitterest potion of slavery.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_QUOD_CORRESPONDENCE" id="THE_QUOD_CORRESPONDENCE">THE QUOD CORRESPONDENCE.</a></h2>

<p class="center oldenglish b15">Harry Harson.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER NINTH.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the same room which has been already described, in Harry
Harson's dwelling, and in one of the stout, plethoric chairs before
mentioned as constituting a part of its furniture, and beneath the
superintendence of the busy clock, and under the watchful eye of
that respectable dog Spite, sat Jacob Rhoneland, with his elbow
resting on the table, his cheek leaning on the palm of his hand, and
his eyes half shaded by his long blanched locks, listening with deep
anxiety to Harson, who occupied a chair opposite, and was speaking
with an earnestness which showed that the subject on which he
discoursed was one in which he felt no slight interest.</p>

<p>The manner of old Rhoneland would have attracted the notice of
even a casual observer. He seemed restless and nervous; and at
times even frightened. Occasionally he smiled faintly, and shaking
his head, half rose from his seat, but sat down, scarcely conscious
of what he did; and leaning his forehead on the palm of his hand,
seemed to listen with breathless attention, as if dreading to lose a
word of Harson's remarks, which were occasionally strengthened
by his pressing his hand gently on Rhoneland's, as it rested on the
table. At last, Harson, in conclusion, said in an earnest tone: 'Now
tell me, Jacob, on your honor, do you love her?'</p>

<p>'Do I love her?' repeated Rhoneland; 'do I love my own little
Kate, who slept in my arms when a child, and who, now that she
has become quite a woman, and I am gray, and feeble, and broken
down, still clings to me? Others found me a querulous, troublesome
old man, and fell away from me; but she never did. Don't
ask me if I love her, Harry, don't ask <em>that</em> again,' said he, shaking
his head, and looking reproachfully at Harson. 'Do I think of any
one else, or care for any one else? Dead and frosty as this old
heart is, she has the whole of it; and she deserves it; God bless
her! God bless her! It's not a little matter that would make me
forget Kate.'</p>

<p>The old man raised his head; and his eye lighted up with an
expression of pride, as he thought of his child. It was transient,
and as it passed off he seemed to be absorbed in deep thought; and
sat for some time with his eye resting on a small speck of blue sky
which looked cheerily in at the open window. What strange things
peopled those few moments of thought; for each moment in the
memory of the old is teeming with phantoms of hopes and dreams,
which once crowded about them; familiar things, part of themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
of their very being, but now melted into air; faded and
gone, they cannot tell when or whither; and of faces and forms long
since shrouded in the tomb. And in the dim fancy of age, in faint
whispers, speak voices whose tones are never to be heard again;
awakening old affections for those at rest, subdued indeed by time,
but yet unextinguished, and slumbering in hidden corners of memory,
and appealing to the heart of the living, and begging still to be
cherished there. Rhoneland sighed as he turned his eyes from the
window, and looked down at his withered hands. 'They were not
so when Kate was a child. He was far from young, even then,
but not so old and shattered as now. Kate's mother was living too;
she was much younger than he was; and he had hoped that she
would have outlived him; but he had followed her to the grave, and
he was left alone with his little girl.' His lip quivered; for he
remembered her watchful kindness; her patience; the many marks
of affection which had escaped her, showing that he was always
uppermost in her thoughts; and that amid all other occupations, she
never forgot him. They were trifling indeed; perhaps unnoticed at
the time; but he missed them when she was in her grave, and they
came no more. She had begged him to cherish and guard their
child when she should be gone, and there would be none to love
her but him. Had he done so? Ay! with heart and soul; with
heart and soul,' muttered he, rising and walking across the room, to
conceal the working of his countenance, and the tears which started
in his eyes.</p>

<p>'Oh Harry!' said he, turning to Harson, 'if you knew all, you
wouldn't ask if I love Kate. She's every thing to me now. All
are gone but her; all&mdash;all!'</p>

<p>He returned, and seated himself, with a deep sigh. His lips
moved as if he were speaking, though no sound escaped them; but
after a moment he said: 'It's all that I can do for one who's dead.'</p>

<p>'I <em>do</em> believe that your child is dear to you, Jacob; I never doubted
it,' said Harson; but there is another question which I must ask.
'Have you observed her of late? Have you noticed her drooping
eye, her want of spirits, and failing strength?'</p>

<p>Rhoneland moved restlessly in his chair, and then answered: 'No,
no, Harry, you're jesting. Kate's eye is bright, and her cheek full
and round; her step elastic and firm. I watch <em>that</em>, Harson. Oh!
Harry, you don't dream how anxiously I watch her. Her life is
mine; her heart's blood is <em>my</em> heart's blood. She's in no danger,
no danger, Harry,' said he, taking Harson's hand between his, and
looking appealingly in his face. 'Is she in any danger? Don't
deceive me. Is any thing the matter with her?'</p>

<p>'No, not just now,' replied Harson. 'But suppose you should see
her becoming thin, and her looks and health failing; and even though
she should not die, suppose her young heart was heavy, and her
happiness destroyed&mdash;and by you?'</p>

<p>The old man looked at Harson with a troubled, wistful eye, as he
said: 'Well, Harry, well; I 'm old&mdash;very old; don't trifle with me,
I can't bear it. What do you mean? Is Kate ill?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>'No, not exactly <em>ill</em>,' replied Harson, much at a loss how to introduce
his subject. 'Suppose, in short, that she should fall in love,
some day&mdash;for young girls <em>will</em> do these things&mdash;and suppose that
the young fellow was a noble, frank-hearted boy, like&mdash;like Ned
Somers, for instance&mdash;would you thwart her? I only say <em>suppose</em>
it to be Somers.'</p>

<p>'Kate doesn't think of these things,' said the old man, in a querulous
tone. 'She's a child; a mere child. It will be time enough
to talk of them years hence. God help me!' muttered he, pressing
his hands together, 'Can it be that <em>she</em>, my own little Kate, will
desert me? I'll not believe it! She's but a child, Harry; <em>only</em> a
child.'</p>

<p>'Kate is nearly eighteen, Jacob,' replied Harson, 'and quite a
woman for her years. She's beautiful, too. I pretend to no knowledge
of women's hearts, nor of the precise age at which they think
of other things than their dolls; but were I a young fellow, and
were such a girl as Kate Rhoneland in my neighborhood, I should
have been over head and ears in love, months ago.'</p>

<p>Jacob Rhoneland folded his hands on the table, and leaned his
head upon them, without speaking, until Harson said, after the lapse
of some minutes, 'Come, Jacob, what ails you?'</p>

<p>Without making any reply to this question, Rhoneland sat up, and
looking him full in the face, asked, in a sad tone: 'Do you think,
Harry, that Kate, my own child, has turned her back upon me, and
given her heart to a stranger? And do you think that she will desert
her father in his old age, and leave him to die alone?'</p>

<p>'Come, come, Rhoneland, this is too bad,' said Harson; 'this is
mere nonsense. If the girl <em>should</em> happen to cast a kind glance at
Ned, Ned's a fine fellow; and if Ned should happen to think that
Kate had not her equal among all whom he knew, he would be perfectly
right. And then if, in the course of time, they should happen
to carry matters farther, and get married, I don't see why you
should take it to heart, or should talk of desertion, and dying alone.
I'll warrant you Ned is not the man to induce a girl to abandon her
friends. No, no; he's too true-hearted for that.'</p>

<p>'Well, well,' said the old man, rising and gazing anxiously about
him, 'God grant that it may never happen. It will be a sad day for
me when it does. I'd rather be in my grave. I cannot tell you all;
but if you knew what <em>I</em> do, perhaps you'd think so too. Indeed
you would, Harry. There's one who knows more about Somers
than either you or I; much that's bad, <em>very</em> bad. I can't tell his
name.'</p>

<p>'I know it already,' replied Harson: 'Michael Rust.'</p>

<p>'Ha!' ejaculated Rhoneland, in a faint voice, his cheek growing
ghastly pale; 'You know Michael Rust, do you?'</p>

<p>'I know something of him, and but little in his favor. What he
says against Somers is not worth thinking of. Let him clear his
own name. Perhaps he may be called on to do it some day, and
may find it no easy matter. And now, my old friend,' said he, taking
Rhoneland by the hand, 'since we have spoken of this Rust, let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
me caution you against him. Listen to no tales of his respecting
Kate, or Ned, or any one else. Beware of all connection with him.
Above all, give him no hold on yourself; for if you <em>do</em>, depend on it,
you'll rue it. I've made inquiries about him; and you may rest
assured that I do not speak unadvisedly.'</p>

<p>Rhoneland had risen to go; but as Harson spoke he sank feebly
in his chair, and buried his face in his hands, his long hair falling
over them, and shrouding them and it from view; but no sound of
emotion escaped him; although Harson could see that he trembled
violently, and that there was a great internal struggle going on. At
last he said: 'It's very hard, Harry, to feel, that you are in the power
of a man who would not hesitate to sacrifice even your life to his
own ends; and yet to know that it must be so; that, hate and loathe
as you may, your fate is linked with his, and that he and you must
sink or swim together. But so it is, God help me! a poor, bewildered
old man! Oh! Harry, could I but die; with none to molest
me, or see me, but my own dear child; with no one to haunt my
death-bed, and torture me; and threaten me and <em>her</em>; and could I
but know that when I am gone she at least will be happy, I'd <em>do</em> it,
Harry, I'd do it! Life is not to me what it once was. It's dull
enough, now.'</p>

<p>'And who is this who has such power over you?' inquired Harson,
placing his hand on his shoulder; 'Come, be frank with me,
Jacob; who is it? Is it Michael Rust?'</p>

<p>Rhoneland started up, looked suspiciously about the room, and
said in a quick, husky voice: 'Did I say it was Rust? I'm sure I
did <em>not</em>, Harry. Oh! no, not Rust. He's a noble, generous fellow;
so frank, and free, and bold. Oh! no, <em>not</em> Rust; he's my best
friend. I wouldn't offend Rust, nor thwart him, nor cross his path,
nor even look coldly on him. Oh! no, no, no! Don't speak of
him. I don't like to talk of him. Let's speak of something else;
of yourself, or Ned, or Kate&mdash;of Kate, my own dear little Kate.
She's a noble girl, Harry, is she not? Ha! ha! <em>that</em> she is!' and
the old man laughed faintly, drew a deep sigh, and turned abruptly
away.</p>

<p>'Harry,' said he, after a pause, 'Will you make me a promise?'</p>

<p>'If it is one which a man may honestly keep, I will,' replied Harson.</p>

<p>'When I am dead will you be a father to Kate?&mdash;love her as I
have loved her&mdash;no, no that you cannot&mdash;but <em>love</em> her you <em>can</em>, and
will; and above all,' said he, sinking his voice, 'let no evil tales
respecting her father be whispered in her ear; let her believe that
he was all that was virtuous and good. It's an honest fraud, Harry,
a deceit without sin in it, and I know you'll do it; for when I'm in
my grave, her heart will be the last hold I shall have on earth.
When the dead are swept from memory, too, the earth is lost to
them indeed. Will you promise, Harry?'</p>

<p>'I will,' said Harson; 'as my own child, will I guard her from all
harm.'</p>

<p>'That's all; and now, God bless you! I've lingered here too
long. Don't forget your promise. I feel happier for it, even now.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Jacob Rhoneland, however, was not doomed to reach his home in
the same frame of mind in which he then was; for he had not gone
a great distance from Harson's house, when a voice whose tones
sent the blood rushing to his heart, exclaimed: 'Ha, Jacob! my old
friend Jacob! It makes my heart dance to see you walking so
briskly, as if old age and the cares of life left no mark upon you.
You're a happy man, Jacob.'</p>

<p>Rhoneland started; for in front of him, bowing, and smirking, and
rubbing his hands together, stood Michael Rust, his eyes glowing
and glittering, with a glee that was perfectly startling. Rhoneland
muttered something of its being a fine day, and of the
pleasant weather, which had tempted him abroad, and then stopped
abruptly.</p>

<p>'You acted unwisely, my friend, very unwisely, in being from
home at such a moment,' said Rust, 'for I just came from there; and
such doings, Jacob! such plots! such contrivances! such intrigues,
and love-making, and billing, and cooing, and whispering! and such
conspiracies against old dad! Not that I believe little Kate has any
thing to do with it. Oh, no! but she's young, and Ned Somers
is&mdash;no matter what. <em>I</em> know what he is; and others know too.
But I never make mischief, nor meddle. <em>I</em> say nothing against him.
No! he's a noble fellow&mdash;very noble; so open and candid! Ha!
ha! ha! I hope you won't go to your house some day and find your
daughter flown, and with <em>him</em>; and I hope if it <em>is</em> with him, that it
will be to the church; that's all&mdash;that's all. Good-bye, Jacob;
I'm in a vast hurry,' said he, bustling off, as if recollecting some
important engagement. 'Dear me! I've lost a world of time.
Good-bye, good-bye. If you should happen to get home soon, you'll
surprise them both.'</p>

<p>As he went off, he turned back, and muttered to himself: 'I've
sown the seeds of suspicion in his heart against his own child. <em>Let</em>
him hate her, if needs be; and let him think her the vilest of the
vile. It will favor my ends.'</p>

<p>The old man stood for a long time where Rust had left him, with
his hands clasped, looking about him with a bewildered air. He
seemed like one stunned by some heavy and overpowering blow.
He took one or two steps, tottering as he went, and then leaned
feebly against a house. The words 'my child! my child!' once or
twice escaped him, in a low, moaning tone; he passed his fingers
over the buttons of his coat, unconsciously twitching and jerking
them; he looked on the pavement, and seemed endeavoring to
regain some train of thought which had passed through his mind;
and then shaking his head, as if disappointed at his want of success,
scarcely knowing what he did, he commenced counting the
cracks in the bricks. A few small stones were lying on the sidewalk,
and he went to them, and idly kicked them off, one by one:
his thoughts wandered from one subject to another, until he began
to watch the smoke, as it escaped from the chimneys of the houses
opposite. Some was dark and brown, and some blue and bright,
and circled upward, until it and the sky became one; while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
other floated off, a dark lowering mass, as long as he could see it.
People were passing in various directions; and he wondered whither
they were going, and how many there were; he commenced counting
them; he made a mistake; he had got to twenty, when three
or four passed together; so he wiped the score from his memory,
and commenced afresh. At last a man jostled him, as he stood, and
told him to get out of the way, and not to occupy the whole walk.
This recalled him to himself; and he set out for home. As he went
on, the recollection of what Rust had told him again crossed his
mind; and his feeling of indifference gave place to one of fierce
excitement. With his teeth hard set, his eyes flashing fire, his long
hair streaming in the wind, his step rapid, yet tottering and irregular,
and with an expression of bitter anger mingled with intense mental
anguish on every line of his face, he bent his steps toward his own
house. It was a bright day, and the warm sunshine was sleeping
on roof and wall; on cellar and house-top, warming many a sad
heart; lighting up many a heavy eye, and calling forth all that is
happy and joyous in earth and man. Strange was it! that under
such a sky, with such a glad world about him, an old man, hanging
over the grave, should dare to utter curses and imprecations against
his fellow man. Yet such was the tenor of his words:</p>

<p>'Curses on them! curses on them!' muttered he; 'the false ones!
When I was striving like a very beast of burden, yielding body and
soul to torments, for her sake, to play me false! It was bitter, but
it was human. Whenever troubles thicken about a man; when he
is blighted and crushed to the earth; when his heart is bruised and
bleeding, and yearns for the love and sympathy of those about him;
when a mild word, a kind look, are of more worth than gold or jewels,
<em>then</em> friends drop off. Suffering and trouble drive off friends,
like a pestilence. I was in drivelling dotage, to think that <em>she</em> would
be aught else than the rest of them. What though I did give her
life, and fondle her on my knee in infancy; and hang over her when
she slept; and pray, come what might to me, that she might be
happy? What though I did cherish and protect her, and love her,
when this old heart was warped against all the rest of the world,
until every fibre of it was entwined with hers; until every thought
was for her; and how I should plot, and plan, and contrive to preserve
the accumulations of a hard life, so that when the earth covered
me, she might live luxuriously, and think kindly of me? What
though I did all this? I became in her way; for I had gold, and
she wanted it! That's it! Oh! what a fool I was,' continued
he, bitterly, 'to imagine that she would prove true, when all others
have proved false; and that gratitude would bind her to me, so that
when I should become decrepid, and so that I could not totter about,
but must mope out the remnant of my life, like a chained prisoner,
that she would be near me, with her bright face and cheerful voice;
and would cheer me up; and would tell me that I had watched over
her childhood; and that she loved me for it. Happy dreams they
were!' said he, mournfully; 'happy dreams! Ah, Kate! my own
little child! you should not have forgotten your old father; indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
you should not. But no, no!' he added, checking himself, 'it could
not have been <em>her</em>; I'll not believe it. It was not her&mdash;poor child;
she never did harm in her life. She was always good tempered,
and kind, and patient. I have tried her patience sadly. As my faculties
desert me, and my mind becomes feebler, I grow more and
more peevish, and I want her more and more. Oh, no! she must
not leave me&mdash;she must not. I'll go to her, and kneel to her, and
pray to her not to turn me off. I am too old now to find a new
friend. I'll beg her to stay with me until I die. I'll not live long,
now, to trouble her; and perhaps she will bear with me till then;
she must not go; oh, no! she must not. <em>Go</em>,' muttered he, his mood
changing, and his eyes beginning to flash; 'go where? with Somers?
with Somers! Can it be that he has been all this while scheming
to rob me of her? Go with Somers? with Ned Somers? <em>He</em> said
he hoped it would be to the church. What <em>did</em> he mean? what
could he mean? But I'll soon know,' said he, hurrying on; 'I'll
soon know!'</p>

<p>Impetuous the old man had always been, though age had in a great
measure subdued his spirit; but now the recollection of Rust's
words lashed him into fury; and when he reached his house, he
dashed into it without pausing to reflect what he should say, or how
he should act. He flung the door open; and, as if to justify the
very tale of Michael Rust, there stood Kate, with her hand in Ned's,
and her head resting against his shoulder.</p>

<p>'Ha! ha! taken! taken!' shouted the old man, with a kind of
frenzied glee; 'taken in the very act! Plotting treason! plotting
treason! It was a glorious conspiracy, was it not, Ned Somers? to
steal into a man's house, and, under the garb of friendship, to
endeavor to wean away his child, and to carry her off? Oh! how
some men can fawn! what open, frank faces they can have! how
they can talk of love, and honor, and generosity! what friendly
smiles they can wear! And yet, Ned, these very men are lying, and
all the while the Devil is throned in their hearts, and sits grinning
there!'</p>

<p>Somers stared at him in undisguised astonishment; for he was
fully convinced that the old man had lost his reason; and under that
impression he placed himself between him and Kate, lest in his
fury he should injure her.</p>

<p>This movement did not escape Rhoneland. 'Good God!' said
he, raising his clasped hands to heaven, 'he already keeps me from
my child! Shall this be? Out of my house! out of my house!'
shouted he, advancing toward him, and shaking his fist.</p>

<p>'Never,' returned Somers, 'until I am convinced that you will not
harm your daughter.'</p>

<p>'<em>I</em> harm her! <em>I</em> harm her!' repeated Rhoneland. 'God of heaven!
what black-hearted villains there are! The very man who would
by false oaths and protestations decoy her from her own hearth, and
when she had deserted all for him, would cast her off, a branded
thing, without name or fame, he, <em>he</em> talks of protecting her from her
own father! No, no, Ned Somers,' he said, in a voice of bitter calmness,
'you may go; I'll not harm her.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>His words had given Somers a clue to the cause of his conduct;
and pale as death, but with a calm face, he said, 'Will you hear me,
Mr. Rhoneland?'</p>

<p>'Hear you! Have I not heard you and believed you? Ay, I
<em>have</em>. I was in my dotage; and you too, Kate, you listened and
believed, did you not? Ah! girl, girl! a serpent charmed in Eden!
But it's past now. I'll love you, Kate, though he do not. They
said that gold was my God. They said that for gold I would barter
everything; but they didn't know me. <em>He</em> told you so too, Kate,
did he not?&mdash;he told you that I'd sell you for <em>that</em>. He whispered
tales of your father in your ear, until you became a renegade at
heart; and <em>you</em>, my own child, plotted with a stranger to desert your
home. <em>He</em> told you that he loved you; and would make you his
wife; did he not? Poor child! poor child! God help her! she
knows no better! Ned Somers,' said he, turning to the young man,
'you must leave this house, and come here no more. My daughter
is all I have to bind me to life, and I cannot spare her. You must
go elsewhere to spread your web. For your vile designs upon her,
may God forgive you&mdash;I never will!'</p>

<p>'Jacob Rhoneland,' said Somers, 'I have borne more from you
than I would have taken from any other man. You are not now in
a state to listen to reason, nor perhaps am I able just now to offer
it; but you have said <em>that</em> of me which I should be false to myself
not to answer; and which I declare to be utterly untrue. I <em>do</em> love
your daughter; and love her well and honestly; and I would like to
see the man, excepting yourself, who dare say otherwise. Some
one has been lying to you; and can I but find him out, he shall pay
for it. <em>You</em>, Kate, don't believe it?' said he, turning to the girl,
who stood by, with blanched cheek, and the tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>'No, no, Ned; I do not; nor will father, when he's calm,' said
she, taking the old man's hand. 'Some person has been slandering
you to him; but he'll get over it soon.'</p>

<p>Rhoneland drew his hand hastily from her, and turning to Ned,
said: 'Leave the house! I have already told you to do so. Will
you wait until you are thrust from it? Begone, I say!'</p>

<p>'Go, go, Ned, for <em>my</em> sake!' exclaimed Kate, pushing him toward
the door. 'He'll never be right while you are here. Go, <em>dear</em> Ned, go.'</p>

<p>'I can't go before I've told your father how matters stand.'</p>

<p>'No matter for that now,' said Kate, earnestly; 'I'll make all
right; go, go!'</p>

<p>Half pushing, half persuading him, she finally induced him to
leave the house.</p>

<p>'Friend Ned seems in a hurry,' said a voice in his ear, when he
had gone but a hundred yards. 'Has sweet little Kate been unkind?
Has she told you that she loved Michael Rust? Ha! ha! Or has
old dad been crabbed? Ha! ha! A queer old boy that dad of
hers, Ned; a queer old fellow; full of freaks! Do you know he
hinted to me that he thought you had an eye on Kate, and wanted
to run off with her? Wasn't that a good one, Ned? Ha! ha! It
makes me laugh to think of it. He didn't know that Michael Rust
was the fellow; that <em>he</em> was the one to guard against.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>'I believe you,' said Ned, bitterly; 'I believe that Michael Rust
is the one to guard against; and Jacob Rhoneland will find it out
some day.'</p>

<p>'To be sure he will, to be sure he will!' said Rust. 'Yet the old
fellow was afraid of you; <em>you</em> Ned, <em>you</em>! He even hinted that your
purposes were not <em>honest</em>. Some kind friend had been at work and
filled his head with queer tales about you. And all the time he
did'nt dream of me; and didn't know that it was <em>me</em> that Kate was
dying for. He'll find me his son-in-law yet, some day. I wish you
would keep away from his house, Ned. To tell the truth, I'm jealous
of you. For in confidence, Ned, I <em>do</em> believe that Kate is a little
of a coquette at heart; and I have often said to myself: 'Although
I see nothing particularly kind in her manner to Somers, who knows
what it may be when they're alone? I'm sure there's nothing in
her actions, when others are present, to betray how kind and coaxing
she is to me when we are alone. Ah! Ned; she is all tenderness
in our moments of privacy. The last time I saw her she said
that she respected you, but swore that she did not care the snap of
a finger for you. God bless her for that! how happy it made me!
how charming she looked! Ah! she's an angel! upon my soul I
must go back and kiss her!'</p>

<p>Somers, chafing with fury at being thus beset, had walked on
with a rapid step, while Rust kept pace with him, hissing his words
in his ear; but as he uttered the last sentence, Rust turned away.
As he did so, Somers caught him by the collar, and drawing him
close to him, said:</p>

<p>'Michael Rust, I believe that every word you have just uttered is
false, and a vile slander against as noble a girl as ever lived. I will
not punish you as you deserve, because I promised Kate Rhoneland
that I would not; but before you go let me tell you this: A greater
liar and villain than yourself, never walked. Things are oozing out
about you, which will make this city ring with your infamy.
Tongues which have been tied by gold have found fear more powerful,
and have spoken; and there are those tracking out Michael
Rust's course, for the last few years, who will not let him rest till
they have run him down. You're fond of figures of speech; there's
one. Now go and kiss Kate Rhoneland, with what satisfaction you
may!'</p>

<p>He flung him from him; and, without looking at him, turned off
in a by street.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER TENTH.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> few words uttered by Somers, as he flung his tormentor
from him, threw Michael Rust into a fit of profound abstraction.
Pondering over his schemes, and wondering which particular one
was about to fail; and yet so confident in his own sagacity and
clear-sightedness, that he felt disposed to think failure impossible;
he took his way to his own house. There, assuming the same costume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
which he usually wore when in his office, and which, in age,
certainly added ten years to his appearance, he locked the door of
his room, put the key in his pocket, and sallied into the street.</p>

<p>'If what he said be true,' muttered he, 'there must be a traitor.
Him I can put my finger on; and first of all, <em>him</em> will I punish;
and now, for a trial of that new animal Kornicker. Bah!'</p>

<p>Had Mr. Kornicker overheard this allusion to himself, it is scarcely
probable that his gratification would have been extreme; for admitting
himself and all the rest of the human race, zoologically speaking,
to be animals; even then, there was much in the tone of
Michael Rust to indicate that Mr. Kornicker belonged to a genus
distinct from and inferior to the human species in general; and this
was a position against which there is little doubt that Mr. Kornicker
would have contended manfully. Without pausing to reflect upon
the justice or injustice of his observation, and in truth forgetting
that he had made it, Rust took the shortest route to his office,
whither, to explain what will follow, it may not be amiss to precede
him.</p>

<p>From the day on which he had taken Kornicker into his service,
he had not been at his office, nor had he met his new clerk, or seen
him, or heard from him. In truth, many other matters pressing
upon him, prevented his calling there; and although he did not
forget that Kornicker was almost a stranger to him, for he forgot
nothing, yet knowing that he could do no harm where he was, and
that there was little to embezzle or steal, except the door-key, he in
a great measure dismissed him from his thoughts, until he required
his services. Although this matter dwelt thus lightly on the mind
of Rust, it was the source of much profound thought and intense
abstraction on the part of Kornicker. He had endeavored to learn
something respecting Rust; and even formed an intimacy with 'the
desperadoes,' for that purpose; and what little he learned there
certainly did not make him more at ease; for even the most desperate
of <em>them</em> shook his head, and gave him a friendly caution
'to look sharp;' at the same time adding, though in less refined
language, that Rust was 'a small colored man, but hard to masticate.'
It was observed, however, that by degrees Mr. Kornicker's
abstraction grew less and less, and his spirits rose. At times,
unnatural sounds, such as loud laughter, and even songs, were
heard to emanate from Rust's hitherto silent room; and in the dusk
of the evening, dim figures were seen skulking to and from it; and
in the day time, shabby-genteel men loitered carelessly through the
entry, and after listening at the key-hole, gave a shrill whistle,
which being answered from within, they dove into the room, and
disappeared. At times, too, the clinking of knives and forks against
crockery was heard from within; and on such occasions, the phantom
of the small boy with a white cap on his head was seen to flit
up and down the stairs, with a dish in his hand, or a bottle under
his arm, always vanishing at Rust's office, or disappearing in the
bowels of the refectory below.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding all these symptoms of returning vivacity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Mr. Kornicker's mind was far from tranquil on the subject of the
mystery of his present situation.</p>

<p>'Fallen into the toils of a little old man,' said he to himself, as he
sat, on the morning on which we open this chapter, in front of the
fire, with his legs stretched at full length in front of him; the toe of
one foot, supporting the heel of the other; of a little old man, with
a red handkerchief tied round his head, a broad brimmed hat on the
top of that, and a camblet cloak over his shoulders. 'It's too deep
for me. I can't fathom it. The victim of a hideous compact,
whereby I am decoyed into his service, to sit in a room eight feet
by twelve, on a chair without a cushion, a yellow wooden chair,
with four legs, and a back made of the most uneasy kind of timber,
probably lignum-vitæ, and yet with no cushion; to wait for people
who never come, eat without drinking, and submit to divers other
small inconveniences; such as bringing up coal in a pail without a
handle; kindling my own fire with damp wood, and snuffing sixpenny
dips with a pair of tongs, one of whose feet is absent.
There's something very mysterious about it&mdash;very. All I hope is,
that this Mr. Rust is not the 'Old Boy.' That's all. I don't wish
to speak disrespectfully of him: but I <em>do</em> sincerely hope, for his own
sake, that he isn't the 'Old Boy.' It would be bad for him, if he
was. As for myself,' said he, drawing out his snuff-box, and snuffing
with great absence of mind, 'it makes no difference; I'm used
to it. I've been brought up in trying circumstances. I slept in a
grocery sand-bin on the north corner of a street for a week. Not
such a bad place either, in warm weather; but I was ousted by a
tipsy gentleman, whom I found there one night. The tipsy gentleman
was sick, too; and when tipsy gentlemen get sick, most people
know what follows. The place was untenantable afterward. But
<em>that</em> was nothing to <em>this</em>; positively nothing. I knew what I was
about then; <em>now</em> I don't. I never met but one case in point with
mine. It was that of the fellow who fell into the clutches of forty
unknown women, and remained with them, feasted with them, and
all that&mdash;they paying the shot, as in my case&mdash;until one morning
they all came weeping, and wailing, and gnashing their teeth, to
tell him that they were off by the first boat; and that he must stay
there until they came back, and might do whatever he liked, and go
wherever he chose, except into the stable. There 's no stable here,
but I'm restricted in liquors; <em>that</em> carries out the simile. The
house-keeper handed him the keys, and he went jingling about, for
forty days, with the keys hanging at his button-hole; his hands in
his breeches pockets, whistling and yawning; locking and unlocking
doors, and smelling flowers; eating apples, and pea-nuts, I suppose,
although they were not specially mentioned, and poking his
nose into all the odd corners. There the simile fits again; only it's
soon got through with here, seeing that there 's only under the table
and up the chimney to look, and I've done both. No matter; that
chap wound up by having an eye knocked out; and I hope the
joke won't be carried so far with me.'</p>

<p>Mr. Kornicker cut short his reflections and remarks; and sitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
upright, pulled up his vest, and felt in the neighborhood of his
watch-pocket. Suddenly recollecting, however, that he had left the
article which belonged there in the safe-keeping of a friend, who,
with a kindness worthy of all praise, not only took charge of it for
him, but actually paid for the privilege of doing so; he pulled down
his vest and said, 'he supposed that it was all right, and that <em>they</em>
would be here presently.' If his last remark applied to guests
whom he expected, he was apparently correct in his surmise; for
he had scarcely uttered it, when there was a single sharp knock at
the door.</p>

<p>'Who's there?' demanded he, without starting.</p>

<p>'Open the door!' replied a voice from without.</p>

<p>'It isn't locked,' said Kornicker; and it might have been observed
that there was a remarkable abatement of firmness in the tone of
his reply.</p>

<p>In pursuance of this hint, the door opened, and in walked Michael
Rust!</p>

<p>Mr. Kornicker, in the course of his checkered existence, had frequently
found himself in positions in which he was taken dreadfully
aback; but it is doubtful whether he had ever detected himself in a
situation which threw him into a state of such utter and helpless
consternation as his present one; for, relying on the continued
absence of his employer, he had that day invited four particular
friends 'to drop into the office,' and, as he had carelessly observed,
'to take potluck with him&mdash;a trifle or so; anything that should turn
up.' This was the very hour; and here was Rust.</p>

<p>He made an unsuccessful effort to welcome his visiter. He got
up, muttered something about 'unexpected pleasure,' looked vacantly
round the room; rubbed his hands one over the other; made an
attempt to smile, which terminated in a convulsive twitching of his
lips; and finally sat down, with his intellect completely bewildered,
and without having succeeded in any thing, except exciting the surprise
and suspicion of Rust.</p>

<p>'There'll be hell to pay!' said he, communing with his own
thoughts, 'there positively <em>will</em>; I know it; I see it, I feel it; I'm
done up; no hope for me! <em>There</em> comes one of them,' thought he,
as a step deliberately ascended the stair; but it passed to the flight
above. There was some relief in that; but it was only a respite.
<em>Come</em> they must! He wrung his hands, snuffed spasmodically,
returned the box to his pocket, and took it out again instantly.
'What shall I do? What <em>shall</em> I do? What the <span class="smcap">Devil</span> shall I do?'
exclaimed he, mentally.</p>

<p>Rust had spoken to him three times, but he had not heard a
word. 'This is all very strange,' muttered Rust, looking about the
room as if to seek some explanation. The first thing which
attracted his attention was the fact that the two chairs which he
had left in the office had by some odd process of multiplication
increased to six.</p>

<p>'There are six chairs here,' said he, addressing his clerk, in a
stern tone; 'where did they come from? Who are they for?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Kornicker looked round, and smiled helplessly. 'Six? Oh,
ay; one, two, three, four, five&mdash;six. So there <em>are</em> six,' said he.</p>

<p>'Well?'</p>

<p>'Well; oh, <em>well</em>? Oh, yes, quite well, I thank you; very well,'
said Mr. Kornicker, whose ideas were rapidly becoming of a very
composite order, and who caught only the monosyllable, without
exactly taking in its meaning.</p>

<p>'I'm afraid that Mr. Kornicker is lonely in the absence of his
friend Michael Rust,' said Rust, with his usual sneer; 'that he finds
this dull, dingy room too dreary for him; and has invited six chairs
to keep him company, and cheer up his spirits.'</p>

<p>Kornicker made no reply; he could not, for he was stupefied by
hearing another step ascending the stairs. This time it paused at
the door, as if the visiter were adjusting his collar, and pulling down
his wristbands; after which, a thinnish gentleman, dressed in a
green coat, with wide skirts; white at the elbows, and polished at
the collar, and pantaloons tightly strapped down, gray and glistening
at the knees, and not a little torn at the pockets, sauntered carelessly
in.</p>

<p>'Servant, Sir; servant, Sir;' said he, nodding to Rust, at the
same time, advancing with a familiar air, and swinging in his hand
a particularly dingy handkerchief. 'This, I suppose, is one of us.
He's an old chip; but he may be come of a prime block.' The
latter part of this remark was addressed to Kornicker; and terminated
with a request, that he would 'do the genteel, and present
him to his friend.' Kornicker, however, sat stock-still, looking in
the grate, and evincing no signs of life, except by breathing rather
hard.</p>

<p>'Ha! ha! Ned's gone again&mdash;brown study!' said the gentleman,
winking at Rust, touching his own forehead, and at the same time
extending his hand. 'It's his way. I suppose you're one of our
social little dinner-party to-day?'</p>

<p>'Yes, oh, yes!' said Rust, quietly; for these words, and the six
chairs, afforded an immediate solution of his difficulties. 'I dropped
in; and being intimate with Ned, thought I'd stop.'</p>

<p>'So I supposed,' said the other. 'As Ned <em>won't</em>, I <em>will</em>. My
name's Sludge, Mr. Thomas Sludge,' said he, extending his hand
to Rust. 'Happy to make your acquaintance. Your name
is&mdash;eh? eh?'</p>

<p>'Quite a common one; Smith; Mr. Smith,' replied Rust.</p>

<p>'Ha! ha! you're joking; but no&mdash;you <em>don't</em> belong to that
numerous family, though, do you? Eh? well; I thought from the
cut of your eye, that you were an old quiz, and supposed, of course,
you were joking.'</p>

<p>At the announcement of the name, Kornicker looked round with
a vague hope that <em>he</em> might have been mistaken; and that it was
not Michael Rust who had thus interrupted his plans; but <em>there</em> he
stood. 'He's a dreadful reality!' thought he, shaking his head.
'He's no Smith. He's Michael Rust. God knows what he's
going to do, I don't. If they come, I pity them. That's all I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
do for them; but it's their affair; they must trust to their own
resources, and the care of an overruling Providence. I suppose
they'll survive it. If they don't, Rust will have to bury them.'</p>

<p>He was too much overwhelmed by what had already occurred,
and by what was to come, to attempt to extricate himself from his
difficulties. They had fallen upon him with a weight which was
insupportable; and now, a ton or two more would make but little
difference. They might mash him flat if they chose; he should not
resist them.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Rust and Sludge became exceedingly sociable.
They conversed on all topics, cracked their jokes, and were
exceedingly merry on the subject of Kornicker and his employee,
and of the tricks which were played upon that respectable personage.</p>

<p>'Ha! ha!' said Mr. Sludge, 'wouldn't he kick up a rumpus if he
did but know what was going on here? The very idea of Rust
arriving at this stage of knowledge, seemed so absurd that they
laughed until the room rang.</p>

<p>It was not long before their number was increased by the addition
of a short, square-built gentleman, with round cheeks and green
spectacles, who was introduced by Mr. Sludge as 'Mr. Steekup,
one of us.' He was followed by a thin fellow in elderly attire, and
with a very red nose. This latter person was supported by a friend
with very large whiskers, and a shaggy great-coat with huge pockets.
The first of these two was presented as Mr. Gunter, and the
last as Mr. Buzby. Each of these gentlemen, as they respectively
entered, went up to Kornicker, and slapped him on the shoulder, at
the same time saluting him with the appellation of 'my tulip,' or
'my old buck,' or 'my sodger,' or some other epithet of an equally
friendly character; to all of which they received not a word in
reply. But though Kornicker's bodily functions were suspended,
his thoughts were wonderfully busy.</p>

<p>He felt that he was done for; completely, irremediably done for.
He had an earnest wish, coupled with a hope, a very faint hope; a
hope so vague and indefinable that it seemed but the phantom of
one; that his guests would be suddenly seized with convulsions of
an aggravated character, and die on the spot, or jump out of the
window, or bolt up the chimney, or cut each other's throats, or melt
into air. He did not care what, or which, or how, or when, or
where. All his thoughts and wishes tended to one particular end;
that was, their abrupt departure, in some sudden and decisive manner.
But they evinced no disposition to avail themselves of either
means of getting out of his way, of which he left them so liberal a
choice. And to increase his misery, amidst them all sat Rust, with
his head bound in his red silk handkerchief, bowing and smirking,
and passing himself off as one of themselves; drawing out their
secrets, and quizzing old Rust, and occasionally casting on his clerk
an eye that seemed red-hot; cracking double-sided jokes, which
made <em>them</em> laugh, and took the skin off <em>him</em>; and calling him 'Ned,'
and asking why he was dull, and why he didn't make himself at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
home as <em>he</em> did; and whether he didn't think that old Rust would
make 'a flare up,' if he should happen to drop in; and why he
didn't ask old Rust to his dinners sometimes; and all in so pleasant
a tone, that the guests swore he was a diamond of the first water,
and Mr. Sludge hugged him on the spot.</p>

<p>Mr. Kornicker wondered if he was not dreaming; and whether
Rust was in reality there, and whether he himself was not sitting
in front of the fire sound asleep. It would be pleasant to wake up
and find it so; but no, it could not be; people in dreams didn't
laugh like these fellows. How <em>could</em> they laugh as they did, when
<em>he</em> was in such a state! How little they understood the game that
was going on! How they'd alter their tone, if they did! It was
ridiculous; it was exceedingly ridiculous. He ought to laugh; he
felt that he ought; but he wouldn't yet; the dinner was to come,
and perhaps he might <em>then</em>; he didn't know; he couldn't say;
he'd see about it. Hark! There was a thump against the wall
below, and a jingling of spoons, and knives and forks, against
crockery. Now for it! Another thump; another, accompanied by
another jingle. He wondered whether the boy had spilt the gravy.
He hoped he hadn't; but supposed he had. It made no difference.
He wondered whether he'd brought the brandy; supposed he had;
of <em>course</em> he had. It only wanted <em>that</em> to damn him! and of course
he would be d&mdash;d. He always had been, and always would be; it
was his luck. The person who was bringing the dinner stumbled
again; but he didn't fall. 'No such good luck! If he had fallen,
if he <em>only</em> had fallen, and broke his neck, or smashed the dinner, or
any thing, to prevent his reaching that door; but no; he was too
sure-footed for that; any <em>other</em> boy would have done so; but <em>he</em>
didn't. He reached the door, and saluted it with a hearty kick; at
the same time informing the company that if they were hungry, he
rather guessed they'd better open it, as his hands were full. Kornicker
thought that <em>his</em> hands were full too; and even had a faint
idea of laughing at this play upon words; but the inclination passed
off without his doing so. Michael Rust opened the door, and the
boy came in. Kornicker knew it. He neither looked round nor
moved; in fact, he closed his eyes; yet he <em>knew</em> it&mdash;he <em>felt</em> it. He
had an innate perception that the boy was there, within three feet
of him, bearing in his hands a large tray, with dishes, and a brandy
bottle on it. And now the clattering commenced; and he was conscious
that the boy was setting the table. What would be the end
of all this; what <em>could</em> be? After all, Michael Rust might be a jolly
fellow, and he hadn't found it out; and perhaps he wanted to make
him at home, and keep up the joke, to save his feelings. He would
be glad to think so; but he didn't; no, no, he was certain that there
was some devil's play going on.'</p>

<p>The only person who seemed fully to appreciate his situation
was the boy from the refectory, who, with the instinct peculiar to
boys of that class, had detected it on the spot; and abruptly placing
a dish on the table, retired to a corner, with his face to the wall,
where he laughed violently in private. A warning look from Rust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
put a stop to his mirth; nor did he again indulge it, until the table
being set, and being informed that the guests were not proud, and
could wait on themselves, he retreated to the entry, where he
became exceedingly hilarious.</p>

<p>'Come Ned, my boy, be seated,' said Rust, going up to Kornicker,
and slapping him on the shoulder. 'Wake up; you know we must
be merry sometimes; and when could there be a better opportunity
than when that old fool Rust is away? He'll never find it out.
Oh, no; come, come.'</p>

<p>Kornicker made a faint effort to decline; but a look from Rust
decided him, and he rose, went to the table, and mechanically
seated himself in the lap of Mr. Sludge, who reminded him that he
was not a chair, but that there was an article of that description
vacant at his side. Kornicker smiled feebly, bowed abstractedly,
and took a seat. He could not eat. He attempted to sip a little
brandy, but choked in swallowing it. The dinner, however, went
on merrily. The knives and forks clattered against the plates; the
roast beef grew smaller and smaller; the vegetables skipped down
the throats of the guests as if by magic; and the bottle knew no
rest. In fact, the only article on the table which stood its ground,
was a sturdy old Dutchman in a cocked-hat, who had been metamorphosed
into a stone pitcher; and sat there, with his stomach
filled with cold water, and his hands clasped over it. Lord! how
merry they were! And as the dinner went on, and the bottle grew
low, and another was called for by Rust, how uproarious they
became! How they sang, and howled, and hooted! What a din
they created in the building! By degrees the entry became filled
with the 'desperadoes' from the upper stories, who, attracted by
doings kindred to their own, accumulated there in a mass, and
enlivened the performances, by howling through the key-hole, and
echoing all the other cries, from the bottom of their lungs. But
loudest and merriest, and as it appeared to Kornicker, most diabolical
of all, was Michael Rust; helping every one; passing the
bottle, and laughing, and yet constantly at work, endeavoring to
worm out of his companions something against Kornicker which
might render him amenable to the law, and which he might hold
over his head; a rod to bend him to his purposes, should he ever
prove refractory.</p>

<p>As the dinner advanced, and the bottle declined, the guests grew
humorous. Mr. Buzby in particular, who after several unsuccessful
efforts succeeded in describing the painful situation of a pig, in
whose ear a dog was whispering some confidential communication.
He also attempted to imitate the remonstrating scream of the
animal; but failed, owing to his utterance having become somewhat
thick. Mr. Gunter then rose to offer thanks to Mr. Kornicker; but
sat down on discovering that Mr. Buzby was terminating his communication
by an address of a similar character; and that Mr.
Steekup was engaged in restraining Mr. Sludge, who was bent on
performing an intricate hornpipe on the table, which he guaranteed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
to do without breaking a plate or discomposing a glass; but which
Mr. Steekup resisted, being of opinion that his guarantee was but
doubtful security. Mr. Sludge, however, was not to be thwarted.
He grew animated; Rust encouraged him; he discussed the matter
vehemently; he addressed every body, on all subjects; he struggled;
he fought, and was finally removed from the room, and cast
into the arms of the desperadoes, in the entry, to whom he protested
manfully against this treatment; and one of the skirts of his
coat, which had been torn off in the debate, was ejected after him.
This occurrence, together with the fact that a third bottle had
become empty; and that no more was called for by Rust; and that
it was growing dark, which was the hour for deeds of chivalry
among choice spirits like themselves, seemed to be the signal for a
general break-up. After shaking hands affectionately with Rust,
and telling him that he was 'a potatoe of the largest kind,' and
slapping Kornicker kindly but violently on the back, and saying
that they were sorry to see him so 'd&mdash;d glum,' they all spoke on
promiscuous subjects at once, and departed in a body, each trying
in a very earnest manner to impress upon the rest something which
he forgot before he uttered it, but which he supposed he would
remember presently.</p>

<p>Rust waited until the silence showed that the guests and the
'desperadoes' had departed together; and then turning to Kornicker,
and rubbing his hands together, said:</p>

<p>'A very pleasant little party we've had, Mr Kornicker; a <em>very</em>
pleasant little party. Michael Rust is much obliged to you for dispelling
the gloom of his office, and making it the gathering-place of
such select society. He can't express his thanks in terms sufficiently
strong. He feels grateful, too, for your strict adherence to
the terms of the agreement between us. Twenty dollars a month,
meals for one, liquor for none. These were the terms, I think;
but Michael Rust is growing old, and his memory may have failed
him. Perhaps, too, brandy isn't a liquor; he isn't certain; it used
to be, when he was a boy; and he doesn't think that it has changed
its character; but it may have done so, and he may have forgotten
it; for you know he's old and childish, and even in his dotage.'</p>

<p>Mr. Kornicker shook his head. 'I knew it must come!' thought
he. He muttered something about his 'standing the shot for the
brandy himself.' He made a futile effort to get at his snuff-box, but
failed; said something about 'apology to offer,' and was silent.</p>

<p>'Well, Sir,' said Rust, after a pause, altering his manner, 'I have
found <em>you</em> out. You haven't yet discovered what <em>I</em> am. Get these
things removed; for I have that on hand which must be attended
to. I'll overlook <em>this</em>, but it must never be repeated.'</p>

<p>'Kornicker, glad to escape thus easily, and yielding, partly to that
ascendancy which Rust invariably acquired over those whom he
made use of, and partly cowed by the consciousness of guilt, and
the fear of losing a comfortable situation, slunk out of the room in
search of the boy from the refectory.</p>

<h2><a name="SABBATH_IN_THE_COUNTRY" id="SABBATH_IN_THE_COUNTRY">SABBATH IN  THE COUNTRY.</a></h2>

<p class="center">BY PETER VON GRIST.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is Sunday in our pleasant village, and the very air seems to
feel it. It is lighter and purer than it was yesterday, and moves
stealthily, as though afraid of breaking the general stillness by its
rustling. The shops are all shut, but there is no gloominess about
them: they too are enjoying the season of rest. And three or four
venerable cows are stretched on the green common, lulled to a state
of philosophic calmness, and sunk in sober meditation. What delicious
music the church-bell makes! It rings out, <i>sotto voce</i>; and the
still, charmed air modulates with a gentle motion, like unbroken ripples
on the surface of a sleeping pond. First comes a single, heavy
peal; then a vibration, like a distant echo; then another, fainter
and more distant still; and another, and another, each fainter and
quicker than the preceding; till in the course of a few seconds
nothing is heard but a confused jingling; and while we are thinking
whether this jingling is not that which we sometimes hear in our
ears at the dead of night, and which we then decide to be fairy-bells,
afar off, another heavy stroke sends down another clear, sweet
wave of sound, and the process of vibrations is repeated.</p>

<p>But now the people from the country around begin to come in.
Huge lumber-wagons, containing farmers and their sons, in Sunday
coats and stiff collars, with their wives and daughters in straw bonnets
and pink ribands, and calico dresses, come rattling through the
streets, and deposit their loads on the church-steps. The villagers
too come out of their houses and walk slowly over toward the meeting-house.
It is easy to distinguish the great men of the place;
(what place has not its great men, on one scale or another?) the
lawyer, the physician, and those older inhabitants, who came here
first, and have grown rich through age. They wear finer clothes,
their boots are polished, and perhaps their faces are ornamented
with spectacles. It is easy to distinguish them, too, by their demeanor.
Their walk shows their consciousness of possessing superior
importance; and a very pleasant thing that consciousness is, on any
scale. Arrived on the steps, they accost each other with affability;
nod to the farmers with benignity, and say, 'How do you do, Mrs.
Johnson?' in an open tone of voice, that the standers-by may see
how friendly they are to all. The young men and maidens look on
them with silent veneration: for from their earliest youth they have
been accustomed to regard Doctor Brown and 'Squire White as
among the greatest in the land; men who had a care over the whole
country, and whose dignity of bearing was the consequence and
indication of that elevation of mind which was necessary in order
to take in such wide views. They are men whose knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
knows no bounds; they are the ones who make speeches on the
Fourth of July; are officers of the temperance society, and the regiment
of militia; and therefore the young men and maidens reverence
them, and the old men make way for them, in the assembly
of the people. It is a natural feeling, natural and pleasant to all
parties; and I cannot tell to which it is the most pleasant, the
admirer or the admired. But they are going in: I enter with them,
and walk down the aisle with a sedate step and slow.</p>

<p>One of those of whom I have spoken last, the doctor, I should
judge from his appearance, has given me a seat in his slip, near the
centre of the church. What a holy repose steals over the spirit, as
we sit down in the house of worship! The strife and turmoil of
the world never obtrude themselves into this sacred place; all are
for a while forgotten. The oil of awe, and yet of gladness, is poured
on the bubbling waters of passion, and they sink to rest. The faint
heart, 'wounded, sick, and sore,' is revived and healed by the very
breath of the sanctuary; for within these walls the air itself seems
consecrated. A solemn and reverential feeling settles down on the
mind of the worshipper; and he involuntarily assumes a serious
deportment. The people come in, one by one, and take their seats
noiselessly, as though they had put off their shoes from their feet
on this holy ground. The light rustle of a lady's dress, and the
occasional slam of a pew-door, in opening or shutting, alone are
heard; and these interruptions only serve to make the succeeding
silence more deeply felt.</p>

<p>I look around on the assembly, and among so many men, who for
the past week have been digging in the earth, or hammering incessantly
on the anvil or the lap-stone, or engaged in the most mean
and unintellectual employments, there is not one careless or vacant
face. Every heart is elevated, and every face is refined in its
expression, by the associations of the place. The humble are
exalted, as it is in man's nature to be, when his eyes and thoughts,
from being fixed on the earth, are lifted up, and hold communion
with things above the earth. Ambition of honor or wealth is
shamed; the world is but a little thing, when, as now, we look
down on it; and here pride finds no place. Care smooths his rugged
brow, and over the sunny face of the maiden steals a shade
of deeper thought. Therefore we are all alike; the barriers of ice
which during the week have separated man from his fellow, are
to-day broken down; and we feel, sitting here worshipping together,
that we are fellow-pilgrims; that we are indeed of the same
family.</p>

<p>Anon the minister comes in, with reverend countenance and careful
step. Every eye is bent on him, with affectionate respect, as he
places his hat on the bright little table under the desk, and mounts
up to, and shuts himself in, the pulpit. Instinctively we all rise
when <em>he</em> does, and invoke the divine presence; though we are conscious
that that presence has been with us, and around us, ever
since we entered the house. When the rustle of re-seating ourselves,
like that of many dry leaves shaken by the wind, has subsided,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
how calmly and soothingly the voice of the speaker falls on
our ears, reading out of the holy book! It is a familiar passage; a
passage which I had heard often and often before I could read it, or
understand all the words; one which I learned by heart almost as
soon as I could learn any thing; which I have heard repeated week
after week for many years; and yet now every syllable is sounded
so distinctly that the picture comes up as vividly as ever, and I cannot
help listening. I forget for the time all that is to come; submit
myself to follow slowly along with the words of the speaker, and
feel my quiet heart overflowing, as it receives the beautiful story,
with its simple and sublime moral.</p>

<p>While I sit and suffer these thoughts, like the spontaneous images
of a dream, to pass over my mind, the hymn has been read, and
my reveries are broken by music from the choir, floating softly down.
I am in no mood to criticise, and it is not difficult to imagine that
the sounds do not proceed from mere human lips; but that beings
who take a deeper interest in man's welfare than he himself takes,
are clothing their words of exhortation or comfort in melody, and
speaking at once to our heart and understanding. If this was not
fully imagined before, it becomes almost real when the last long-drawn
note dies away, as though the sweet minstrels had accomplished
their mission to this earthly tabernacle, and had departed
toward their own abode.</p>

<p>And now rises the preacher, severe and grave. Every glance is
directed toward him, and every ear is open to catch the first, long-coming
accents. I do not wonder that they love to gaze on him;
even I do now. He is a man past the prime of life; gray hairs
are plentifully sprinkled over his head; his face is somewhat thin
and worn, as though with long watching and study; but his frame
is upright, and the look which he slowly casts over the expectant
congregation, is full of import and solemnity. There is a mild,
affectionate light in his eye, and love to God and to all God's creatures
beams out from every lineament of his countenance. Calmly
he displays, after the good old fashion, his handkerchief of spotless
white, and calmly deposits it under the right lid of the book before
him. There is such an air of quiet dignity about the movement,
that I love him for it. But the preparations are all gone through
with; a routine which we would not miss, and which he would be
lost without. He reads his text with emphatic enunciation, and
begins his heart-felt address. It is evident that he does feel it. I
cannot doubt it for a moment, when I look on his face. I can <em>see</em>
that it is heart-felt; and therefore it is not strange that it should be
heart-felt by his hearers too.</p>

<p>What a luxury to hear those plain truths! There is no mystery
about them, no darkness. The mind is not led off into futile speculations
concerning things infinitely above its reach, or so subtle as
for ever to elude its grasp; but the grandest principles&mdash;and there
are none but what are grand&mdash;appear on their natural level, the
level of the humblest comprehension. While we are least thinking
of it, the good man turns some general remark, in the truth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
which we have just acquiesced, toward us, personally, as individuals;
meanwhile, by his eye, making every hearer feel that <em>he</em> is
meant. I cannot divert my attention; I am compelled to think only
as he wills, and am startled by the conviction which forces itself on
me, so personally does he speak to me, that he is looking strait into
my heart. The chapel becomes a hall of justice; my evil motives,
and passions, and actions, in long array come thronging up, and I
must perforce sit in judgment on them. No excuses or shiftings
avail; in the twinkling of an eye, I see the character of the motive
or action, and, in spite of myself, decide justly respecting them. It
is humbling, truly, and it ought to do me good.</p>

<p>In fact, it <em>has</em> done me good already, as well as the rest who hear.
For now, when the speaker comes to tell of love, and goodness, and
mercy, how much sweeter sound the words than ever they did
before! The house itself seems lighter, and the faces of all in it
are brightened, like the faces of men which have been darkened
through fear, under the shadow of an eclipse, when it passes happily
away. We all feel that it is good for us to be here, and are
surprised that it is so late, when, after another brief prayer, we are
summoned to rise and receive the benediction&mdash;it seems to me that
we should kneel to receive a blessing from such lips&mdash;and the
morning services are over.</p>

<p>If I followed my inclinations, I should stay here during the intermission;
but that would expose me to notice; so I take up my hat,
and mingle in the crowd which is pouring out. How different
from the crowd which one meets in the saloon of fashion, or at a
political meeting, or at any other place, where men are accustomed
to congregate! Here we are all jostled together, but gently, decorously.
We do not lose sight of ourselves, or of the dignity of
reflecting beings. We are rather a company so full of the thoughts
which we have just received, that we must think them all over
again, and have no time to stop and exchange compliments, or to
respond to them with laughter equally inane. Not even when we
emerge on to the common, and all take our diverging ways toward
home, can a voice be heard rising higher than a whisper. A Sabbath
stillness reigns over all.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, the scene is much the same as in the morning.
With the first stroke of the bell, I take my former seat, and occupy
myself with turning over the leaves of a pocket-Bible that belongs
to the slip. There is rather more confusion and noise of people
coming in, than there was in the forenoon. Footsteps fall heavier,
and pew-doors slam louder. A few old ladies, collected into two or
three contiguous seats, for the purpose of enjoying, in the interval
of worship, a little whispering consultation, have not yet intermitted
their humming voices. Children, released from the Sunday school,
come clattering along the aisles. Young gentlemen and ladies do
not appear quite so stiff as they did in the morning, and are not so
careful that their attitudes should be exactly perpendicular. The
chorister also makes some remarks to the choir on the importance
of keeping time, and on sundry other things, in a tone of mild command.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
All these little things go to make up a good deal of confusion
in the house; all which, nevertheless, it is exceedingly pleasant
to sit and listen to.</p>

<p>But the pastor enters; the bell ceases its tolling; the whispering
old ladies disperse themselves to their respective seats; the deacons,
who have been waiting for the minister on the steps, follow him in;
and in less than a minute silence once more settles down on the
assembly.</p>

<p>It may be fancy, but it strikes me that the choir sing a trifle
louder and freer than before; that the female singers put in variations,
which are not set down for them in the book, sliding graces,
one might call them; all indicative of increased confidence in their
own powers. However this may be, I am certain that the young
damsel in the slip before me, whose face I have not seen, is mingling
her voice in the harmony. I can almost hear it. But while I
am watching to catch her tones, a universal shutting of books
announces that the hymn is ended.</p>

<p>It may be fancy, too, but the preacher seems to me a thought
less solemn than in the forenoon; perhaps a little warmer and more
animated. Perhaps, too, the hearers are more restless and disposed
to be critical. There is not that same hush of breathless listening.
But they are sweet words; and the speaker appears to be conscious
that he is not giving utterance to idle breath, so deliberately
and thoughtfully do the lessons of good come from his lips. And
this deliberation and thoughtfulness increase as he draws near the
close of the sermon; till at last, his voice is sunk almost to a whisper;
and our attention has to be closely riveted to catch the sounds.
Now may be seen the whole congregation bending forward with
strained eyes, and animated faces, drinking in the thoughts and
precepts, and exhortations, as though for their lives. And when the
conclusion of the whole matter comes, '<i>And thereby shall ye have
hope of eternal life</i>,' and during the deep pause which succeeds the
enunciation of these words, an hundred long-drawn sighs may be
heard, telling of relieved and lightened bosoms.</p>

<p>After the prayer, a hymn is read; a good old hymn, unmutilated
from Watts, and we all rise to sing it. It is set to a good old tune
too, one with which every body is familiar, and the first verse is
carried roundly off. The second verse sets in heavier; the voices
of the singers grow louder through use. The bass, which before
was rather faint, now comes out with the power of a dozen organs,
from fifty pairs of lungs that never knew what weakness was. The
air, too, has cast off its timidity, and rises high and shrill; while the
alto and tenor, each clear and distinct, fill up the intermediate space,
and all four blend together harmoniously, so that no jar or dissonance
is perceptible. The tide of song sways up and down, like
the breathless rocking of the wave. The whole house is crowded
with sound. The voices gush out and swell with measured movement;
and while the different parts combine and unite, a mingled
stream of harmony and praise is sent up toward the heavens. It
is evident that the hearts of the singers are rising with their words.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
I can speak for myself, at least; I find it difficult to resist the current
of enthusiasm; so I allow myself to be borne away; and,
albeit somewhat unskilled in the gentle art of psalmody, into this
grand hallelujah chorus I cast the strength of my voice with right
good will.</p>

<span class="smcap">Copied from Mrs. Pettit's Album at Rockaway.</span><br />
</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> winter had given a few premonitory symptoms, the winds
beginning to come with a cutting edge from the north, the last flowers
of the season having long dropped their disconsolate heads,
where they had been cut down in their late bloom, and short icicles
depending from the eaves on the frosty mornings. One by one, the
charms which crown the country during so many months, its roses,
its green-sward, its foliage, nay, even the melancholy tints of autumn
were withdrawn, until all was bare and desolate, and there was
nothing left of all the glorious scene, except to those who can bow
down to Nature in her severest moods, and can admire the symmetry
of the dismantled oak with as true a feeling as when its
limbs were robed in green. Still can you see in its majestic trunk
and faultless anatomy, why it bore its honors so gracefully. But
the woods were literally stripped. Here and there a dry leaf,
crumpled up, shook on the end of a limb with a palsied motion,
producing a death-noise, not unlike the reiterated strokes of a small
wood-pecker's bill upon the bark. For the rest, a thin layer of dry
leaves whirling about among the skeleton shadows of trees, or
gathered together in the hollows and the valleys, was all that remained
of the tissue of that massive, overarching pall which stretched over
the forest for miles. How contractile is the power of death!
Caw! caw! caw! The crows flapped their jet black wings over
the region of desolation; and hark to the roar of the distant sea!
The beautiful shores of the Long-Island Sound, its promontories,
coves, and recesses, so late the resort of the invalid or the idle; the
trout-streams, the wide plains, the forests filled with sleek deer, as
also the places of note upon the sea-shore, had become deserted.
Montauk-Point jutted out into the sea more lonely than ever.
Glen-Cove lost all its charms, and not the least were those it borrowed
from thy presence, glorious Araminta! The Baron Von
Trinkets swore that he would die for thee. The Pavilion at Rockaway,
where beauty and fashion had so lately woven the dance,
was forsaken in all its halls, corridors, and piazzas; while the old
steward sat by night in the kitchen-wing, tapping his feet on the
hearth to the remembered music of galopades, and voluptuous
waltzes. It was, in fact, the latter end of November&mdash;a pretty
season for an excursion into the Tinnecum bay!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Tertullian insisted upon my going with him to shoot black duck,
which were said to be more plentiful than for many years, affording
great sport. But water-parties, to my mind, cease to be desirable
when coal fires have become agreeable. Nevertheless, <i>ad sauromatas,</i>
to oblige a friend. So we overhauled lock, stock, and barrel,
which had become rusty since snipe-shooting, and, busying ourselves
a whole evening in screwing, unscrewing, oiling, and getting
in order our implements to make war upon the black ducks, the
morrow found us ready. Tertullian shook me by the shoulders
as I lay softly pillowed, and in the midst of pleasant dreams. With
a yawn and a groan I acknowledged the salutation, and looking out
saw the stars yet shining in the sky. The morning air felt cold!
cold! As I stood shivering in my long robes, I was ready to sacrifice
my friendship for Tertullian, and to plunge again beneath the warm
sheets, and recur to my happy dreams. The rolling of wheels over
the frozen ground beneath the windows, and Cudjo's sharp
reproaches to the mules, indicated that all parties were on the
ground; and although I considered it almost as bad as fighting a
duel at that unseasonable hour, I clenched my teeth with determination,
as if to preclude the possibility of a shiver. In a few
moments we were armed and equipped, provisions for the day
were placed in the bottom of the wagon, and Cudjo drove us out
on the commencement of the cheerless journey. My friend, lover
as he was of aquatic pastimes, and wild-duck shooting, shrugged
his shoulders as we passed over the bleak meadows. There had
evidently been a fall of snow during the night, somewhere among
the Highlands, to judge by the sharper edge of the winds. In the
course of half an hour we arrived at a landing-place, where a small
creek put up from the bay. Here two negro boatmen, from New-Guinea,
a small African settlement in the neighboring woods, had
consented to meet us, and row us out in their new sedge-boat,
which was first called the Pumpkin-Seed, from some allusion to its
shape, but afterward from their own names, <span class="smcap">The Sam and Jim</span>. On
arriving at the wharf nothing presented itself but the old mill, with
its wheel encased in ice, and as far as the eye could reach, the
bleak meadows and the tortuous creek, and the Tinnecum bay.
But the black gentlemen who were to be our guides did not show
their faces, but were probably with the rest of New-Guinea dreaming
of clams and eels, or of the gala-day when their new boat,
fresh and gaudily painted, was launched into the black waters,
below the dam of the Three-Mile Mill. The 'Sam and Jim' lay
high and dry upon the shore, chained, padlocked, and protected
from the weather. It must be confessed, that the promise of the
day's sport was small. With no Palinurus to guide us, and the
wind blowing as if it came from an iceberg, the black ducks might
take a new lease of their lives, for all the damage we should do
them. Tertullian swore roundly, stamped his feet, and went raving
round the old mill, which we tried to enter, but the doors were
locked. Then getting upon a pile of mill-stones he gazed wistfully
into all quarters of the horizon, and raising his trumpet voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
as if he had been among the very huts of New-Guinea, called upon
the delinquents, Sam and Jim. Still no human being appeared to
offer assistance, and echo only answered 'Sam and Jim.' The
sun began to appear well above the horizon, the tide was on the
ebb; if a little more time were lost, it would be impossible to get
over the bar, and return by night-fall. The miller's house stood
near, whither we immediately hastened, and having aroused him
by a volley of kicks against his door, asked his ghostly advice
about an expedition into the bay. Joe Annis thanked us in language
not very flowery for breaking his slumbers, and then telling
us that his two boats, the 'Spasm' and 'Paroxysm,' (so named by
some country doctor in that vicinity,) were a little way down creek,
and that we might take either one, and row ourselves out, drew in
his powdered head. Difficulties only serve to quicken the energies
of men of nerve. '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Courage! courage! mon ami!</i>' exclaimed my
friend, wagging his haunches in the direction of the wharf in a great
hurry. Tertullian was for ever speaking French and Latin. The
first was tolerable, as far as it went, which was to the end of a very
small vocabulary; but for the latter, Erasmus help us! it was of the
canine species, except some few phrases, very pure, drawn right
out from the body of the Roman authors. Of the latter was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quid
agis?</i> 'What are you about there? What are you doing&mdash;in the
stern of the boat? <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ohe! jam satis!</i> Come, no more of your fun.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dic, age tibia.</i> Wake up, and tune your pipes.' But then, the
melancholy, barbarian ages succeeding, '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Miror quid diabolus faciemini
sine Sam et Jimmo!</i>'</p>

<p>On examining the boats, we found them not very well adapted
to the purpose. They were rather small skiffs, and might be easily
tilted over, or capsized in a squall. We took the <span class="smcap">Spasm</span>. She was
clean, tight, and ready to be launched; but the <span class="smcap">Paroxysm</span> was in
bad condition, full of mud, grass, clams, shells, broken rum-jugs,
and decayed cucumbers. In a trice we had effected the launch,
victualled the boat for a day's voyage, and seizing the oars pulled
with great vigor and hearty determination. We had been both
indifferently acquainted with the bay, knew its shores, and bottom,
and the fishing-grounds which were once visited with success. But
such knowledge acquired in school-boy days had become dim. It
might be that the old land-marks were destroyed; for if a certain
row of poplars which stood upon the plain had been cut down
during the prevailing unpopularity of poplars, we might be puzzled
to find the entrance of the creek upon our return. 'Courage!
courage!' exclaimed Tertullian; 'range your eye along the summits
of the salt hay-stacks, thence onward over the ridge of the old boat-house,
and you will see the trees, with their dry and decayed limbs
rattling aloft, like pipe-stems:</p>

<p class="center">
'Altas maritat populos.'
</p>

<p>The broad expanse of the bay seemed to lie before us at a little
distance, but the course of the stream was winding and ambiguous,
often making a turn and bringing you back to nearly the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
place, which by dint of laborious rowing you deemed you were
leaving far in the back-ground. Thus, often in life, do we seek to
arrive upon the scene of some expansive prospect, but that which
seemed a little interval turns out to be a weary distance, to be overcome
only by patient determination. The exercise of pulling at the
oars sent warmth through our bodies, and made the blood tingle in all
our limbs, although the flags upon the shores were glazed, and sharp
icicles hung from the banks, which the sun had not yet power to dissolve.
At last the shores began to widen, and we emerged into a
broad basin, where, coasting warily for a while, we ventured upon
another more expansive. Here we saw a loon, who screamed out
when he saw the skiff, in great alarm; but no harm was done to him.
Some pieces of ice were seen floating, not of any great size. Having
pulled heartily thus far, we considered it 'about time' to take a
small pull at the brandy-bottle. The sun was by this time pretty
high up in the heavens; the day though cold was of an amber
clearness; the black ducks pretty scarce; but other things promising
well, Tertullian broke out into music; a jovial, marine song, of which
he expected me to sustain a part in the chorus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Cheer up, my jolly boys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In spite of wind and weather,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cheer up, my jolly boys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And&mdash;&mdash;'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">'<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mehercle!</i>' exclaimed he, breaking off suddenly, '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ecce duos oves!</i>'</p>

<p>'Where?' replied I, in astonishment, looking up to the sky, and
suspecting that he made some punning allusion to a few fleecy
clouds.</p>

<p>'Two teal, by Jupiter!' said he, cocking his piece, and rising up
in the boat with great eagerness. Looking in the direction to which
he pointed, I saw the birds rising up and down on the rough waves,
and occasionally bobbing their heads beneath the brine. There is
a grace and sleek elegance which belongs to animals in their state
of utmost wildness, that is incomparable. Swans in the tranquil
lake, and kine in the richest pastures, are beautiful for the eye to
rest on. But the bird which looks out from some high, extreme
limb in the wood&mdash;even if it be the small, red robin, stretching out
its long neck, and displaying an elegance of form, very different
from its summer plumpness, ready to flap its wings at the merest
crackling of a leaf, or approach of the distant shadow; the straggler
from that long file of migratory birds, (how beautifully it undulates,
and swerves from a rigid line in yon high aërial flight,) descending
to bathe in the woodland swamp, and plunging its head deep into
the waves as the quick eye of the sportsman, the flash, and the
report are simultaneous; the stag listening with erect ear to the fall
of far-off footsteps in the forest, and expressing in that tremulous
air the full force of his incipient bound;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&mdash;&mdash;'Non sine vano<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aurarum, et siliiæ metu;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">these express an idea of ecstatic life and enjoyment, which it is
difficult for the painter to depict.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Tertullian could not get a shot at the teal, for they went under,
and never came up again, that we could discover. Nor was the loss
of sport to be regretted, as, had he discharged his piece standing,
heavily loaded as it was, the recoil would have been sufficient to
upset the skiff. Such casualties are not infrequent. It was near
this very place that Pomp Ruin, poor black! in his eagerness to
shoot a wild duck, got kicked overboard, and went down, with all
his sins upon his head; and as the colored clergyman truly observed,
in improving the subject on the Sunday following: 'My brudren,
he was never hëered of arterwards.' Coasting along still with resolution,
we doubled Cape Round-your-hat, and it being high-noon,
drew up on the beach at Rider's to dine. An hour and a half was
suffered to elapse before we got off from this sterile place, and the
afternoon beginning to wear away in divers cruisings, we thought
it high time to begin to think of a return.</p>

<p>We had been resting on our oars for a few minutes, Tertullian
ceasing from his French and Latin, and maintaining a profound
silence. 'Hearken!' said he, suddenly rising up, in an attitude of
intense listening; 'it is the surf bursting upon the shore!' I put
down my ear, and heard the hollow, heavy roar, and booming of the
breakers, rolling upon the beach at Rockaway. 'We are near
the mouth of the inlet,' said he; 'pull for the point of yonder island,
or we shall be carried out to sea.' I remembered a story told me
by Captain Phibious, of the small schooner Sally Jane, who got carried
out into the Gulf Stream, four or five hundred miles, without
provisions, in which expedition all hands liked to have perished.
Fear lent strength and vigor to our arms. Into what peril were we
brought through the remissness of those irredeemable negroes Sam
and Jim! With such good effect did we pull at the oars, that in a
little while we struck the point of land, and leaped upon the shore
in safety. 'Do you know where you are!' exclaimed Tertullian.</p>

<p>'Certainly not, except upon a desert strip of sand.'</p>

<p>'You are on Scollop Island.'</p>

<p>My blood froze in my veins. 'We are then,' said I, 'upon the
dominions of Floys Boyo, and within the precincts of the <span class="smcap">Devil-Tavern</span>.'</p>

<p>'The same,' answered he; 'let us draw up the boat.'</p>

<p>Scollop Island, whither we had now come, was a small, barren
place, which lies just at the mouth of the inlet, opposite to the
Rockaway beach. It consists of little hillocks of white sand, and
intervening valleys, with here and there a few groves of pines, and
gnarled oaks, whortleberry-bushes, and brambles, or whatever will
grow on so unpropitious a site. Beside these, there is at any time
little sign of life. Only one house or tenement was visible upon its
highest point, before which the broken mast of some wrecked
schooner was planted in the sand; and half way up jutted out a
sign, on which was painted some figure, not intended to be human.
Some beaks, figure-heads, and gilded ornaments, the relics of
unfortunate ships, lay about, or were nailed over the doors. The
house, it must be confessed, had never borne an excellent reputation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Gibbs and Wamsley had resorted to it frequently, and are
said to have made some deposits of treasure in the sands of the
island which have never yet been turned up. The boatmen who
tarry there usually do so, for the purpose of some drunken spree too
riotous and noisy for the main land. But the Devil-Tavern had at
least one merit, for it discarded all semblance of hypocrisy, and did
not even assume to itself the vestige of a good name. It may be
said that the present one was forced upon it; at any rate it had
borne it a long time, and put forth no protest to vindicate the reputation
of the house. The virtuous were afraid of it, and preferred,
if carried thither in some summer excursion, to wander about the
hot beach, rather than seek the comparative coolness of its walls.
It had received its name for many reasons, any one of which might
be deemed sufficient. A hundred years ago its founder was a man
of such outrageous character, and withal so successful in his career,
that it was thought the very Devil helped him. He was leagued
with wicked landsmen, who, when they had accomplished their
nefarious plans, sailed hither, and revelled jollily until the storm
blew over. Many a bottle of pure wine was cracked in their convivialities,
very different from the vile and burning fluids now served
up at the bar. But Cargills was at last hanged, having been taken
unawares at the Anchor Tavern, in New-York, whither he went
when oppressed with ennui, and to get his feelings in tune. A set
of landlords succeeded him, any one of whom had made society
too hot to hold them. At last a certain humorist who happened to
be there, snatching a pot of paint one day, which was near at hand
to paint the bows of a schooner, clambered up by the aid of a ladder,
and inscribed upon the sign-board, with great freedom of brush,
a picture of that ancient gentleman, the Devil. He painted him
<em>rampant</em>, with all that dismal aspect which is usually attributed to
him, with hell-flames bristling from his forked tongue, his tail coiled
up and superfluous, while in the back-ground was an extent of
highly picturesque country, whence he had just issued, seeking
whom he might devour. The semblance must have been correct,
since by those that came there, the recognition was pleasurable and
immediate. Indeed, the frequenters of the place for the last fifty
years had been distinguished by the harsh term of hellicat devils.
Latterly, nothing specific had been alleged against the Inn, only
some murderous suspicions connected with the gangs which frequented
it, and the very unsatisfactory character of a bad name.</p>

<p>The present landlord, Floys Boyo, came here originally from
Thimble Islands, and managed to gain a miserable subsistence
throughout the year by the entertainment of strangers, and the sale
of strong waters. Of whatever else he did for a living, there are no
witnesses. We now proposed to make his acquaintance, and we
could have wished under better auspices, unless his hospitality
would overflow toward those thrown by accident upon his shores
at an inclement time. Objects were waxing dim in the declining
light, and the 'wind of the winter night' blew dismally around the
coasts of Scollop Island. We drew up the skiff upon the land,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
took our over-coats and fowling-pieces, and went in the direction of
the house, along the ill-beaten tracks, with heads bent down to
shield us from the sharpness of the wind. Tertullian received my
reproaches for bringing me upon the expedition, and for conducting
the ship into such a harbor. The appearance of the house, upon
a nearer aspect, was eminently cheerless, without tree or dried bush,
or enclosure, or domestic animals, or any thing to remind one of
life, or cheerfulness, or hope. The wind had blown the white sand
to the very threshold of the door, while, scarcely visible in the
declining day, the Devil looked down upon us with a malignant
leer. A dim light appeared in front at the windows, through the
only panes of glass the house could boast. Nearly all were shingled
over, or otherwise stopped. The barking of a dog would not have
been unwelcome, though it had been a snarl. It was a place into
which one feels an instinctive reluctance to intrude.</p>

<p>There are some houses which by their very air and aspect, as
plainly as if characters of hospitality were written upon the lintels,
extend to the stranger the undoubted welcome of a home. Others
are guarded in all their avenues by their own repulsiveness. We
inspected the premises narrowly, examined the house on all sides,
as if the entrance were doubtful, then came again in front, and
looked up at the eaves. A little smoke curled out of the chimney,
indicating the presence of small warmth within. Tertullian set up
a strong claim upon the sympathy of the convent, by hammering
against the door with his musket. A response came from within
like the howl of a wild beast aroused from his lair, an outburst of
compound curses, unknown to the every-day swearer. 'Floys Boyo
is in his tantrums; knocking is too gentle an etiquette at the Devil-Tavern;
he must be mollified with hard words, and subdued with
counter-oaths. Follow me,' said Tertullian; 'it is but a specimen of
his airs and graces.'</p>

<p>Pushing into the room, we found it black and dismal, and all
things in correct keeping. The smell of gin filled it like a fume.
In one corner a small greasy enclosure of boards, breast-high, likewise
shut off by pendant pickets from the wall above, formed that
spiritual sanctum, usually called the bar. Behind it were a number
of dripping glasses, whose only washings were from the dregs of
those little corpulent barrels, and whose only wipings were from the
foul lips of the frequenters of the Devil-Tavern. An irregular file
of bottles and cracked decanters eked out the remaining crockery.
The beams and walls of the room overhead were darkened with
smoke; the floor was filthy; and greasy, unwashed vessels lay
about in profusion, among the remnants of chairs, and broken benches,
and the last timbers of a cradle, of which the baby was gone.
Three men moped in the fire-place, thrusting the heels of their
gigantic boots into the coals, muttering and cursing in cheerless companionship.
They were without coat, vest, or neckcloth, their red
shirts were open upon their necks and hairy bosoms, their marred
faces, lip-corners streaming with tobacco, harsh beards, and shaggy
heads, made them look like a group of infernals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Floys Boyo, the captain of this delectable crew, was distinguished
from the rest by a scar or gash, which from the corner of his eye
came down his right cheek in a deep gulley as far as his nose, where
it branched off, and cut his upper lip into two parts, which had been
ill patched together.</p>

<p>'We're going to lodge here,' said Tertullian, walking up and slapping
Boyo upon the back.</p>

<p>'H&mdash;ll!' replied the other, not pretending to move from his
seat, while the rest of the company rolled up their eyes in silence.</p>

<p>'Yes; and want some south-side clams for supper; there's bread
enough in the boat.'</p>

<p>'You won't get no supper, and there's very little lodging for you.
Do you think we're as dead as door-nails, d&mdash;n you, and as deaf
as stones? Hammer the door down next time, will you? Bullion,
call the old woman.'</p>

<p>It was evident that Boyo meant to entertain us, notwithstanding
his threatening and sullen aspect; and although he fulfilled his word
by making no preparations for supper, yet a chamber was getting
ready for our repose in the cockloft of the Devil-Tavern. This, in
the inclemency of the season, and the want of another house or
place of shelter on the island, we considered a piece of princely
hospitality, worthy to be paid with gold. Ensconced within the
jambs of the fire-place (how different from the blazing, hospitable
hearth of the farm-house!) we read the horrid physiognomies around
us, and did not derive much comfort from the perusal. Silence
reigned in the company. The men had arrived at that brutal stage
of the process of intoxication, when the excitement of the brain
having passed away, there comes a sullen mood. A host of worse
spirits take possession of the man, which, if they are not so turbulent,
are of a more fiendish nature. The dull eye, the downcast
look, the moping silence, show forth the vile temper which lays its
vindictive hands on a woman, and speaks harsh words to the wife
of one's bosom. Then come lust, murder, revenge&mdash;the passions
which vaunt themselves less furiously at other times, and the slow
working resolve of the mutinous.</p>

<p>The night became colder, and the fire more dim. Floys Boyo
ordered Bullion peremptorily to fetch some 'kindlings.' The latter
did not disobey the command, but went out grumbling, and returned
with some sticks, and wreck-wood, and by the aid of the paint
which adhered to them, a more cheerful flame was produced. But
it only served to make the darkness more visible; to bring into
stronger relief the bar, the cobwebbed ceiling, the filth and squalid
wretchedness of the apartment. An uncomfortable feeling of insecurity
increased upon me, notwithstanding Tertullian's perpetual
'<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Courage!</i>' and'<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cras magnum iterabimus aquor</i>.' Extremes are always
suggestive of their opposites. I thought of the cheerful study at
home; the fire blazing; the faces of friends; the hot-pressed volume,
the Magazines for the month. There, by the side of Blackwood,
brought in violent haste by the last steam-packet, lay the <span class="smcap">Old Knick.</span>,
first in our affections, whose plain exterior of blue but ill bespeaks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the luxury within; whose pages, co-rivals of the Alpine flakes, are
never stained by impurity; but there the old man chirrups with the
vivacity of youth, and the young has managed to assume the wisdom
of the sage. Both meet together in loving cheerfulness, and
the ancient sits in his gubernatorial chair, and puffs the long pipe
in that dreamy atmosphere. Let the old Dutch spirit reign for ever
in 'our beloved regions of Manahatta.'</p>

<p>A prisoner for the night in that dreary place, I felt as if I were a
thousand miles from the abodes of civilization; and as one naturally
does, amused myself by examining with intense curiosity the most
indifferent object which served to remind me of more congenial
places. I kept my eye long fixed on the lock of my fowling-piece,
which had the word 'London,' and the maker's name engraved upon
it; then looked in the bottom of my cap, and was peculiarly interested
with the vignette which accompanied the manufacturer's
name; and an old almanac seemed to link me with the literary
world, although it was out of date by several years. The pictured
little page, and calculations of eclipses which had come off, and
gone into the musty record of by-gone events, the signs of the
zodiac, the prophecies of wind and weather, the old maxim of 'early
to bed and early to rise' and the way to make an apple-pudding,
these had a fresh interest and a zest hardly to be equalled by Bulwer's
last novel. I felt that there must be an 'imperfect sympathy'
between Scollop Island and the great world of literature, art, and
learning.</p>

<p>But a deeper sense of satisfaction and security arose from the
presence of woman. A fair face and a fragile form glanced occasionally
across the apartment where we were seated, but retired,
driven back by harsh words and vile language. It was the wife of
Floys Boyo. She bore about her the marks of former beauty,
although altered in all its lines by a prevailing expression of wo, but
she still performed the duties of a wife with unflinching patience,
though coarse and cruel treatment had long since rendered it a heartless
task. Floys Boyo married her in the comparative innocence of
his youth, before he had yet blunted all the kindly feelings of his
nature. He had taken her from the abounding plenty of a farm-house,
and from parents who loved her with the tenderness which
falls to the lot of an only child. Afterward, as is always the case
with a drunkard, he cherished her no longer with affection; dragged
her about from one comfortless abode to another; and at last, on this
desert place, cut her off from the last link which attached her to her
friends. Still she adhered to him, when she might have returned to
the bosom of her family; so hard is it to shake the fidelity which is
a component part of a woman's nature, and so often in this world
are the extremes of disposition linked together, the fierceness of the
vulture with the enduring gentleness of the dove!</p>

<p>It was not until a late hour that we left the kitchen of the Devil-Tavern,
and retired to our apartment for the night; for the prospect
of sleep did not bring with it much consolation, although extremely
weary. Floys Boyo conducted us, leading the way up the steps of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
a perpendicular ladder to a landing, whence he stepped into a cockloft,
set down the lamp on an empty barrel, and departed with an
oath, grumbling about the trouble which we had given him, and
wishing us in the Rockaway surf. 'He is an atrocious devil,' said
Tertullian; 'let us inspect the den, while the lamp holds out to
burn.'</p>

<p>We found neither lock, catch, nor fastening of any description;
and to have our slumbers supervised by any of the amiable crew
below, was not pleasant. Having tortured ingenuity a little, we
took an eel-spear and a broken oar which lay on the beams beneath
the roof, crossed them, and secured them against the door by the
aid of some tarred ropes, which were likewise at hand. Then we
made a broken barb of the spear serviceable by jamming it violently
between the floor and the lower part of the door; after which we
lugged a heavy old chest, and deposited it, together with whatever
movables were to be found in the room. This done, we threw
ourselves down upon the straw in all our clothes, drew over us our
cloaks, and over these the blankets which belonged to the bed, and
placing our fowling-pieces by our side, abandoned ourselves to the
protection of a kind Providence. In less than half an hour Tertullian
snored prodigiously, and had I been stretched on clover, fanned
with the sweetest airs of summer, and without a care to ruffle my
tranquillity, I never could have slept a wink with such an uproarious
fellow beside me. As it was, there were other causes which kept
me wakeful. For, beside the fears which might assail one at midnight
in such a solitude, it was dismal to hear the winds raving
about the house; the bricks tumbling from the chimney and rolling
with a hollow noise down the roof; the blast now screaming in your
ear and instantly heard afar off, as if it had gone off to join the
troops of the winds; the rattling of doors and loosened window-frames,
and the creaking on its rusty hinges and slam-banging of the
sign of the Devil-Tavern. To this might be added the moaning of
pine trees as their heavy tops swayed in the grove, the plashing of
the waves on the still shore, the roll and confusion of the breakers
at Rockaway. How impatiently I counted the hours, and longed
again for the light of day, that scatters fears and vagaries with the
brooding shades, and imparts fresh life, and courage, and determined
zeal.</p>

<p>It must have been half past two o'clock, or thereabout, in the
morning, when, being all on the alert, I was sure I heard a movement
in the house. A sound came from below stairs like the gruff
voices of men engaged in low conversation. It kept dying away as
the winds exceeded it in loudness, and then it came back monotonous,
and was continued several minutes without cessation. Then
a door opened, and a confused whispering succeeded, after which,
slowly, and with a creaking noise, I heard steps, one by one, ascend
the rungs of the ladder; and springing up on my elbow, my heart
thumped so furiously, and my brain whirled in such confusion, that
for a moment I could hear nothing. But a bar of light coming
through the crevice in the partition, flashed across the wall. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
there was an evident pressure and force applied to the door, which
it resisted well. I sprang out of bed, pressed my eye to a crevice
in the wall, and saw the red-flannel shirt of one of the men; then
rushing back, I shook Tertullian violently by the shoulders. He rose
up a moment, uttered something impatiently, and fell back into bed.
'Tullian!' said I, shaking him energetically, 'Tullian! Tullian! up,
for heaven's sake! we shall be&mdash;(here I placed my mouth close to
his ear, and whispered)&mdash;<em>murdered!</em>'</p>

<p>He pressed his fists to his eyes, and sprang upon his heels. I
never knew him wanting in an emergency. He rallied his senses,
and understood my suspicions in an instant. He understood them,
and supposed them ill-founded. But as we stood with our fowling-pieces
in our arms, the violence against the door was continued,
with angry imprecations, by those without. It was evident that the
pressure of the whole gang was upon it, and it could not hold out
long. What could we do against their numbers, and with so contracted
a place for battle? 'Up with the window and out of it!',
exclaimed Tertullian. As he uttered the words, he sprang toward
the sash, uplifted it, and told me to leap. I set my foot upon the
sill, crouched down in order to squeeze through the narrow aperture,
and sprang in safety upon the sands below. The distance was not
very great, but it was a leap in the dark. Before I could look up
for him, Tertullian was by my side, the sash slamming down as he
leaped, and the broken glass tinkling in little pieces at our feet. At
the instant a crash, an onset was heard above; oars, eel-spears,
chest, chairs, and the whole barricade must have given way, a light
streamed into the room and lit up the casement, shadows flitting
about; a shout and confused mingling of voices met our ears; we
could distinguish those of Floys Boyo and his men: 'The birds
have flown!' 'To the shore! to the shore!' exclaimed Tertullian,
grasping my arm, and attempting to hurry me along.</p>

<p>It was very dark, and I remember that we rushed through the
deep sands in company with frantic haste, never turning round, now
cast down by getting our feet entangled in briers, then panting on
against the cold night wind. It seemed as if our pursuers were
very near us, nay, almost at arm's length, outnumbering us, with the
weapons of death in their hands, and the only remedy was to flee,
flee for our very lives! Already I imagined the grasp of Floys
Boyo upon my throat, and the death-struggle near. Life, with its
delightful memories, its hopes of the future, the loves and affections
which were in store for me, a host of ideas and emotions rushed
through my brain with the rapidity of characters perused upon the
same page. There was a sudden and intense conception of the
preciousness of life, and the agony of losing it; and persisting in
the chase, I felt as one does who labors under a horrid night-mare,
and is pursued by phantoms or fiends, while his limbs refuse to do
their office, and his shrieks are inaudible murmurs, which die away
in the utterance. Oh, my sisters! my fair cousins! dear, and beautiful
betrothed! would to God I had never come to Scollop Island!
Onward, onward we went, scarce guided by the dim star-light.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
'Tullian, Tullian, I can go no farther; we can never reach the
water's edge!' Scarce had I spoken when the ground gave way
beneath us, we plunged forward, and sank into a hollow twelve or
fifteen feet. Breathless and wearied, we lay together in the sand,
with our fowling-pieces by our side. We were in a sort of cavern,
where the earth caving in stood around in semi-circular walls, and
was slightly arched above us. The place was sheltered from the
northern blast, and a pine grove partly shielded it from the icy breath
which came over the waves, while the sun had shone all day upon
its sands.</p>

<p>Were we pursued by the gang?&mdash;or had my fears as well as my
ears deceived me. 'Hush!' whispered Tertullian; 'do you hear
voices? Here they come! Lie perfectly close; if the worst comes
to the worst&mdash;&mdash;' At the instant a clamor was heard behind us,
as if a half a dozen men were calling to each other from different
points; it came nearer, and ever and anon the oaths of the crew
were borne with horrid distinctness to our ears. Floys Boyo's hoarse
voice called his men to follow him to the shore. They passed round
the hollow where we lay buried, through the pine grove, and so
down to the water's edge, where their lanterns kept flashing about
as they ran upon the sands with a vain search, and we heard the
hollow tramp of their feet, as they leaped upon a sedge-boat which
lay anchored near by. We examined our locks and percussion-caps,
and lay silently, looking up at the stars, in painful doubt and suspense,
as to what issue was at hand; and unwilling to part with our
'sweet lives.'</p>

<p>How dreary and disconsolate were those moments! What a contrast
with the present, the scene which I had witnessed only three
evenings before; lights, and voluptuous music, beauty, and the
dance; now Scollop Island, Floys Boyo and his chosen men, and
above us the cold sky, about us the howling winds, and perpetual
roar and confusion of the sea. Hark! that was a woman's voice!
A scream! Inarticulate sounds come up from the shore, as if
another boat well manned had arrived. They are on the return to
the Devil-Tavern. They approach us; now they are by the pine
grove; their indistinct forms are visible by the light of the lanterns;
Bullion stood there in a horrible tableau! 'To Bone Cavern! to
Bone Cavern!' we heard them say, but the wind blew the remaining
words away. 'Tullian! Tullian! now comes the trial! Here
they are!' murmured I, leaning my head upon his shoulder. 'Stand
fast! stand fast!' replied he. We held our hands upon the triggers
of our fowling-pieces. The men stood upon the bank directly
above us, causing the loose sand and gravel to roll about us, and
bury us still deeper, while the twigs and bushes were now and then
illuminated by the dancing lights which glittered upon the ends of
our guns.</p>

<p>It seemed at that moment that my heart, which had been fluttering
so long and fast, became perfectly calm, and wound up by the
excitement of the crisis which had at last come. I lay there, uncertain,
yet ready and composed, listening intently to every word which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
they said. While I ardently awaited their movements, they turned
their backs upon the place where we lay, and moved off; the light
of the lanterns disappeared; their voices becoming more and more
indistinct, at last died away; and except the waves which plashed
upon the shore, there reigned a deep silence: we were comparatively
safe. We drew the sands around us, and lying close together
in our coats composed ourselves for the night. In a little while
Tertullian snored; and I myself, overwrought with excitement, fell
fast asleep. It was a sleep without dreams; and when we awoke
the sun had risen, and was shining into our eyes. We sprang from
our resting-place, clambered to the summit of the bank, and looked
around us in the direction of the Devil-Tavern. There hung its
sign, still creaking in the breeze, but not a sign of life appeared
around it. Its inmates must have resigned themselves to slumber.
It was a bright day, and the solitary island looked pleasant. We
ran to the shore, pushed off the skiff which lay safely in the place
where we had drawn it, seized the oars, and pulled merrily. The
breeze blew cold, but refreshing, and the sun glanced over the
waves. We were full of life and vigor, delighted with the idea of
a safe return. In a little while we paused to release some choice
spirits which were imprisoned in a bottle of old Otard. Tertullian
poured forth a volume of pure Latinity, and again a chorus was
heard over the waves which might have roused Floys Boyo and his
crew:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Cheer up, my lively lads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And&mdash;&mdash;'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">The 'Spasm' shot over the waves with the speed of light; the
shores faded in the distance; our ancient adversary the Devil was
lost in his pictured proportions; and with a light heart we bade farewell
to Scollop-Island, and to the hospitalities of the <span class="smcap">Devil-Tavern</span>.</p>

<h2><a name="CA_ET_LA" id="CA_ET_LA">CÀ ET LÀ.</a></h2>

<p class="center">BY THE FLÂNEUR.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is the beginning, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">premier pas qui coute</i>, in all compositions.
Once started, there is no difficulty in proceeding; but how to begin!
Shall we borrow of the prolific <span class="smcap">James</span>?</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Upon</span> a lovely morning in November, that season of the year
when the woods have doffed their summer green to robe themselves
in sombre russet, two horsemen were seen riding down a glade
of one of those noble old forests which are still to be met with in
some parts of England. The elder of the two, a fine, soldier-like
figure, sat his horse,' etc., etc. And there we will leave him, and
look out for our own beginning. Strange that a chapter on this
subject is nowhere to be found in any book on rhetoric or criticism.
For our part we are determined not to begin at all for the present,
but to propound a number of queries suggested to us by the name
of the exuberant novelist above mentioned.</p>

<p>First, then: Why are tears always called 'pearly drops?' Would
not that definition apply better to drops of milk? Lands have been
said to flow with milk, but never did the wildest romancer assert
that the lachrymal duct in the human subject was a milky-way.</p>

<p>Then, why does the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chevelure</i> of dark-haired persons always
resemble the 'raven's wing?' Why not his tail-feathers, occasionally,
for the sake of variety? Or a crow's wing, a black-bird's
wing? Or why not say, 'Dark as the wool on negro's poll?'&mdash;or
as the mane of a bay horse?&mdash;or 'as black as my hat?' Is it absolutely
necessary that it should always be a raven's wing?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>When you say, 'cherry lips,' do you particularize sufficiently?
Some cherries are yellow, some black. Should you not say '<em>red</em>
cherry lips? If any 'young orphan' happens to be engaged in
novel-writing when cherries are in season, let him place two in
juxta-position, and remark what a mouth such a pair of labia would
make! Why are these cherry lips always slightly parted? Does
not this give that stupid expression which the French call '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouche
béante</i>?</p>

<p>Why are all necks, not bull-necks, 'swan-like?' Why does swan-like
in necks mean beautiful and well-proportioned, and crane-like
abominably extended, when the neck of a crane is no longer than
that of a swan? Why are handsome noses always 'chiselled?'
Why are fingers always 'taper?' And finally, for we must stop somewhere,
why are beauties '<em>lovelier far in tears</em>?' Did swollen eyes,
bound with red, and nose pinkish in tinge at its extremity, ever
improve the appearance of any mortal since the flood?</p>

<p>As it is not fair to destroy without creating something to supply
the place of the destroyed, we take the liberty of showing our own
ideal in stories:</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Upon</span> a crimson sofa, in a darkened room, sits a lovely lady.
Bright are her eyes as gas-lights in a shop-window; dark her hair
as Day and Martin's best; and her red lips contrast with her white
skin as do the red stripes with the white in Stewart's peppermint
candy. Salt tears trickle from her eyes as fall the drops from an
umbrella in a gentle November drizzle; and James's last novel lies
unnoticed upon her lap. Why sits the lovely lady on the crimson
sofa? And why does she rest her pensive and pomatum'd brow
upon her embroidered handkerchief?'</p>

<p><em>That</em> we flatter ourselves <em>is</em> an exordium, over which a discerning
public may hang entranced.</p>

<p>'This young lady was hight Liner, Catherine Julia Liner. She
wept for love of Shuffleshank, her inconstant beau.</p>

<p>'For one whole season Shuffleshank, whose soul, if he had any,
was in his toes, hovered about Miss Liner, and attended her every
where. He waltzed with her night after night, (and Shuffleshank
twirled divinely,) and in the pauses of the dance he wiped the perspiration
from his face, and with his touching and tender eyes,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'Gazed on the fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Who caused his care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wiped and looked, wiped and looked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wiped and looked, and wiped again,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">until her parents and herself were quite certain of an offer. He
certainly owed her one. She deserved some compensation for
listening to his interminable stories, which were as monotonous as
long. So celebrated a narrator was he, that his friends, when
endeavoring to give each other an idea of some distance traversed,
would say, 'It was one of Shuffleshank's stories,' or two stories.
Sometimes unfortunate men could tell of a six-story walk, and
these were looked upon as persons of great strength and vast
powers of endurance. But the heartless, ungrateful Shuffleshank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
allowed the mercury to descend in the thermometer of his affections
for Miss Liner, and gradually his attentions grew colder and colder,
until they sunk below zero and became neglect. But the faithless
one did not long survive his treachery. He broke his wind in
attempting to finish his tenth story that day, and expired soon after
suddenly. He was discovered lying on his back, his toes turned
out, and his head resting on a volume of Cotillons <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à quatre mains</i>.
His executors found among his papers the first sheet of a pamphlet
on his favorite science, waltzing, dated only a few days before his
decease.</p>

<p>You will pardon us, friend <span class="smcap">Knickerbocker</span>, for giving your
readers one or two original rules of so great a professor:</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Rule</span> I. The <em>cavalier</em> should endeavor to waltz with women
of a suitable size. The relative test is, that the noses of the couple
be on a level.</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Rule</span> II. He should put his right arm as far round the lady's
waist as possible, and draw her toward him with the other hand, so
that the noses before mentioned shall be not more than half an inch
apart.</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Rule</span> III. In case the lady should be inclined to jump, he
must hold her down to the floor by pressing firmly upon her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tournure</i>.'</p>

<p>Society has indeed suffered a sad loss by his untimely death.
But before we go any farther with our story, we will give a crow-quill
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">croquis</i> of the career of Miss Catherine Liner, down to the
period of Shuffleshank's catastrophe.</p>

<p>'Miss Liner was of a good family: her pa, a retired merchant,
with some tincture of the humanities, and she herself well educated;
that is, she knew enough Italian to say <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pesch'e</i>; enough
German for '<i>es ist warm</i>;' and enough French for '<i>Oh, vee</i>.' Music
she loved to distraction. True, she sometimes nodded at a concert,
but then it was only to beat the time, and when awakened by a crash,
she would shake her head in languid ecstasy, and sigh out a sentimental
'<em>ah!</em>' Or, if the nature of the air required it, she could shout
in a voice sonorous as a cricket's: '<em>Divine!</em>' '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">magnifique!</i>' '<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">grandioso!</i>'
or the hardest word she might remember out of any language.
The gentlemen in waiting caught the cue; and men who
had not ear enough to keep time when dancing, were unintelligibly
scientific in <em>allegros</em> and <em>andantes</em>, and made frequent and familiar
allusions to Hummel, Meyerbeer, Beethoven, and Weber. We
ourselves must plead guilty of claiming an acquaintance where we
never had an introduction. How true is that saying of Fuller:
'The best of God's children have a smack of hypocrisy!'</p>

<p>Miss Catherine's papa Silas was rich, and Miss Catherine was
fashionable. She came out and offered a book-muslin view of
herself to two hundred and fifty warm people. Bouquets, ay,
double-bouquets, were sent her by insane beaux, by means of which
young gentlemen who only knew two ladies in the room were converted
into flower-stands for an hour or two, trying to look easy and
at home, by gently rubbing the camelias against their noses from
time to time. And when Miss Catherine had given a ball herself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
then did she become perfect in manner; then handled she her fan
with consummate dexterity, and adopted an expression of intense
fashionable agony when a badly-dressed woman passed by, or a
clumsy <em>Unshuffleshankian</em> waltzer ran against her. Then sighed
she in German to a gentleman from Connecticut, lisped in French
to a dandy from Philadelphia, and whispered in Tuscan to her
Italian master, if he happened to be within hail. Then waltzed
she with young men, warm or cold, dry or moist; she would have
taken a turn with a steaming tea-kettle, if tea-kettles wore white
vests and <em>valsed</em>. Then danced she like a Bacchante, and only left
the ball-room just before the lights; while melancholy Silas, pining
for his pillow, clasped his hands and sometimes muttered, 'Ultima
July;' and sometimes, as if desparing of rest below, '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in c&oelig;lo quies</i>.'
To have seen Miss Catherine Julia, you would have sworn that she
was a descendant of Lord Lanesboro', <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">si passionné pour la danse,</i>
who, after the death of Prince George of Denmark, waited upon
Queen Anne, and advised her to take a quarter, by way of consolation.</p>

<p>Let us pause a while to take breath.</p>

<h2><a name="OUR_PUBLIC_MEN" id="OUR_PUBLIC_MEN">OUR PUBLIC MEN.</a></h2>

<h3>NUMBER ONE.</h3>

<p class="center">PERSONAL TRAITS OF PRESIDENT TYLER AND HIS FAMILY.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> interest which is felt in the personal history of a distinguished
man is materially increased in the person of Mr. <span class="smcap">Tyler</span>,
for and against whom so much has been said and written. And as
I am no politician, but have had the opportunity of seeing a great
deal of our Chief Magistrate, personally and in private, I propose
to give to the readers of the <span class="smcap">Knickerbocker</span> a few personal characteristics
of the President, drawn from my own knowledge and
observation. They are not in themselves of any deep interest,
being such as arise in the every-day occurrences of life; but they
therefore the better portray <em>the man</em>, and are of much interest on
that account.</p>

<p>I remember one evening that a plain countryman from the interior
of Pennsylvania called upon the President, and seemed to eye
him with keen scrutiny. He was evidently a person well-to-do in
the world; who owned the acres that he tilled, and had a good many
broad ones; a holder of his own plough, from habits of industry
rather than from necessity; and one who, evidently, had always
spoken his mind without fear or favor. His plain but clean attire,
and his honest, open countenance and proper bearing, struck me
very forcibly, and reminded me of a remark which I once heard
General Harrison make of Tecumseh, the celebrated Indian warrior,
who has been called the 'Napoleon of the West.' General
Harrison observed that the Indian was one of the most gentlemanly
men he had ever seen. I asked him how that could be?</p>

<p>'Why,' he replied, 'he had self-possession and self-respect.'</p>

<p>This old farmer had these manly qualities. After a long chat
with the President, he observed:</p>

<p>'Well, Mr. Tyler, you are a very different man from what I took
you to be.'</p>

<p>'How so?' asked the President, laughing.</p>

<p>'Why I thought you were a large, red-faced, haughty man, with
your hair combed back and tied in an old-fashioned cue, and that
you were as proud as Lucifer. Why, you are as plain as a pikestaff,
and as free-spoken as if you had no secrets in the world. I
am glad I came to see you, Sir; I have been much deceived.'
And so has every man been much deceived who has taken upon
hearsay personal prejudices against the President. His personal
appearance is very prepossessing. He is above the middle height,
and slim, with long arms, and a quick, active gait. His forehead is
prominent and very intellectual, with the perceptive faculties,
according to phrenology, strongly developed. His hair is light and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
thin, and mixed with gray. His eye is a light blue, quick and penetrating;
at the same time it is frank and open, with a quiet humor
lurking in the corner. His nose is remarkably prominent, cheeks
thin, and mouth compressed. The whole face is full of character,
and the features are remarkably plastic and expressive; changing
with every shade of thought that passes through his mind. He is
said to bear a strong resemblance to the <span class="smcap">Duke of Wellington</span>, but
his features have none of that rigidity which marks those of the
Duke. His conversational talents are of the first order, and he
tells a tale with great unction and glee, and with remarkable effect.</p>

<p>I remember the first time I saw the President, I was invited to
dine at the White House by his son; and it so happened that after
dinner I fell into conversation with the Chief Magistrate upon
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jefferson</span>, of whom he spoke in terms of great enthusiasm. I
have since seen a letter from an old friend of the President's, reminding
him that he had often expressed the wish before the decease of
Mr. Jefferson, an event which, from his advanced age was long
expected, that he might deliver his eulogy. It so turned out that
the President was appointed; and any one who will read the different
eulogies pronounced upon Jefferson, will be struck with the
republican appreciation of his character and virtues which Mr. Tyler
has set forth with such earnest and vivid eloquence.</p>

<p>I remember well seeing the President the day after the first veto.
Great excitement prevailed in all parties throughout the day. The
avenue was alive with groups of people in earnest talk, and many
visiters, particularly, members of the Democratic party, repaired to
the White House at night to tender their thanks to the President
for the course he had pursued.</p>

<p>In the dead of the night the inhabitants of the President's square
were aroused by the shouts of a drunken mob, who, with discordant
fife and old tin-pans for drums, proceeded to the executive mansion
and yelled, in consequence of the veto, those insults in the ears of
the President and his family, among whom was the wife of the
President, then in extremely delicate health. The day after all
this, I met Mr. Robert Tyler in the street, as I was proceeding to
my dinner, who invited me to dine with him, observing that there
was nobody at the house but the family. We entered the White
House at the southern front, and found the President seated with
his son Tazwell by his side, a lad of fourteen, whom the President
was teaching his lesson. It instantly struck me that there was a
moral energy in the President of which his enemies little dreamed.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Peace has her victories,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As well as war;'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">says Milton, in his splendid lines to Cromwell, and this is one of
them. For months every persuasion to which eloquence could give
power, had been exerted on the President, to obtain his veto on the
one hand, and his signature on the other. The Whig party, in the
plenitude of its power, personified in the person of their bold leader,
the 'lord of the lion heart and eagle eye,' and standing on the
grave of General Harrison, hallowed by his death, and full of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
dictation of success, felt themselves like Olympian Jove with
thunderbolt in hand ready to strike down to endless political perdition
the 'Acting President' if he dared to veto. The threat was
made in tones of thunder, by their great champion. But, lo! the
veto came, and calm amidst the breaking of the storm, the President
was teaching his little son his lesson. It was a Roman one.
In the battle-field a moment often decides the victory. A moment
of decisive action which requires no wear and tear of spirit for days,
weeks, and months&mdash;amidst imprecations and execrations&mdash;but an
energy which springs to life on the instant, such as Napoleon
exerted at Lodi, but which exhibits no greater powers of purpose
than President Tyler exhibited&mdash;for none but those who witnessed
it, can have any idea of the many and the powerful influences
which were brought to bear, to obtain the President's signature to
the Bank Bill&mdash;influences exerted not only by the distinguished
and the powerful, face to face with the Chief Magistrate, but through
the portentous threatenings of anonymous letters, of the most
assassin-like and dastardly character.</p>

<p>We all remember the effigy-burning that succeeded the veto, and
which, the President said, 'served but to light him in the path of
duty.' A little anecdote which occurred at the dinner-table one day
between Mr. John Tyler, Jr. and the President, will show how good-humoredly
the President bore a jest upon the subject. There were
several young gentlemen present at table, guests of the sons of the
President. The Chief Magistrate sat among them, enjoying the talk
with apparently as much interest as if the magnates of the nation
were around him.</p>

<p>The conversation happened to turn upon the question as to which
was the greatest man, Napoleon or Cæsar; and during the conversation,
Mr. John Tyler, Jr. chanced to observe, that he had seen it
stated, that Pompey's statue, at the base of which Cæsar fell, had
been discovered in some excavations made in Rome. 'Ah?' said the
President; 'well, John, was there any blood upon it?'</p>

<p>'You don't believe it, I suppose, father?' said the son.</p>

<p>'Why, John, I don't doubt that you have read of the excavation,
but I doubt very much if it was truly Pompey's statue; for, after the
lapse of so many centuries, the authentication of the statue must
be very doubtful.'</p>

<p>'Well, Mr. President,' replied his son, very archly, 'I will tell you
of one thing, of which there will be little doubt.'</p>

<p>'What's that?' asked the President.</p>

<p>'Why, some years from this, when some well-digger, or house-builder,
or other person, is excavating in the neighborhood of
Nashville Tennessee, Louisville Kentucky, or some other place
that might be named, he may light upon a stuffed Paddy some six
feet high, the earth half burned, with a rope around its neck: 'Ah,
what's this?' some one may inquire. 'Why,' replies another, 'it is
the effigy of that John Tyler, who vetoed the Bank Bill!'</p>

<p>'Ah,' said the President, laughing heartily, 'you have me there,
John.'</p>

<p>I may here remark of Mr. <span class="smcap">John Tyler</span>, Jr., who is the private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
secretary of the President, that he is a very handsome man, with
courtly manners; that his partialities are to the study of the sciences,
rather than to politics; and that he has written a pamphlet upon
electricity, which is said to exhibit much knowledge and originality.</p>

<p>Those who have not witnessed the terror which prevails among
the clerks, on a change of parties in power at Washington, or even
of a change of the head of a department, who, it is rumored, intends
to make removals, can have no idea of it. Some poor clerk, who
supports a large family upon one thousand or twelve hundred dollars,
may have inadvertently let slip an imprudent expression, which
some ready spy retails and makes public, with a thousand exaggerations,
and, lo! the report takes wind that he is to be removed.
Then comes the distress of his agonized wife and children, while
the poor woman hurries to the President, or to the head of the
department to which her husband belongs, to intercede for him, and
save herself and family from ruin.</p>

<p>When General Harrison came into power, multitudes of such
fears prevailed, and with fearful truth for their foundation. The
good old General himself had no wish to proscribe, but proscription
was the word with too many of his friends. I may mention a
circumstance which came under my own knowledge.</p>

<p>The head of a certain department, shortly before General Harrison's
death, turned out a clerk of his, who was accused of having
busied himself in politics&mdash;a poor man, who had a wife and six
children. She is a beautiful woman, but twenty-six years of age.
Her agony was such as to render her almost insane. The removal
left her and her children houseless and homeless, with the husband
and father in debt. Fiction has wrung many a heart to tears with
a fancied picture not to compare in sorrow to the truth of this.
Shortly after this removal, General Harrison died, and was laid in
state in the hall of the White House, whither flocked multitudes to
gaze upon his lifeless remains, and reflect upon the instability of
earthly power, and the vanity of all human greatness. I met the
lady of the removed official with, another lady, and but one escort,
on their way to look their first and last upon the departed President;
and I joined her. General Harrison I had known well, and I
spoke of his goodness of heart, and manliness of character, as we
proceeded, with an earnest truthfulness, which seemed to impress
the wife of the official, by whose side I walked.</p>

<p>'I blame &mdash;&mdash; for my trouble,' she said, naming the head of the
department, half to herself; 'I believe the old General was good-hearted.'</p>

<p>We entered the White House. In state, just before the entrance,
lay the General. His features were placid, and betrayed little or
none of the sufferings of the departed spirit. My companion gazed
upon him earnestly and long, and then said, with a hysteric start:</p>

<p>'I would to God it was &mdash;&mdash; who was lying in that coffin! I'd
give a party to-night, poor as I am!'</p>

<p>One may well fancy how deep the agony of heart of a sensitive
lady must have been, to wring from her such an expression. In
fancy, she heard the voice of her children crying to her for bread;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and to her excited mind they appeared before her, dead as the
departed President, and of hunger; for so she said, in speaking of
her expression afterward.</p>

<p>It was a scene, in those days, to see the department 'let out,' as
the boys would say at school. The aspect of those clerks whose
political bias was known to be against the party in power, was
lugubrious enough. They did not look like gentlemen who, after
their official labors were over, were going to their dinners, but as if
they were wrapped in sorrow, and wending to a funeral.</p>

<p>One day, shortly after the succession of President Tyler, a certain
gentleman turned out fifteen of his officials, in one fell swoop.
They got their notices that their services were no more needed by
the department, about two o'clock, <small>P. M.</small> The public gardener
happened to be in the President's grounds when he heard the news,
and seeing the President on the portico, he advanced to him and
said:</p>

<p>'Mr. President, only think of it; they're turning all the poor
clerks out.'</p>

<p>The President immediately despatched a note for the official,
who was soon in the President's presence, and ready to recount
the political sins of the expelled.</p>

<p>'Reinstate them,' said the President; 'I cannot bear to have their
wives and children coming to me with accounts of their sufferings,
when I can prevent it.'</p>

<p>The President never thinks of making a display of mere official
dignity. He never thinks of the <em>President</em>, unless he is fulfilling
some presidential duty, or unless some one presumes, from his kindness
of manner, to encroach upon his dignity; and then the
encroacher instantly discovers how much he has erred. This, more
than one senator and representative can tell, who has undertaken
the task of dictation to the President.</p>

<p>Dickens, who found so much fault with our institutions, and our
people generally, justly remarked of our Chief Magistrate, when he
called to pay his respects to him: 'The expression of his face was
mild and pleasant, and his manners were remarkably unaffected and
agreeable. I thought that in his whole carriage and demeanor he
became his station singularly well. And yet, as I have before said,
he never seems to think of the display of official dignity.'</p>

<p>A distinguished artist who had been employed by the King of
France to copy Stuart's full length likeness of <span class="smcap">Washington</span> which
hangs in the White House, was invited by the President to be his
guest while copying the picture. The President also employed him
to take the likeness of himself, Mrs. Robert Tyler, and his youngest
daughter, Alice. The artist's manners were distinguished by the profoundest
observance of courtly etiquette; and the Jeffersonian ease
of the President's manners served to surprise him. I remember one
day while the family circle were all seated round the fire after dinner,
the artist rose, and with a profound salaam, said: 'Mr. President,
with your permission I will retire to my work.'</p>

<p>'My good fellow, do just what you please,' replied the President,
good-humoredly smiling, as the artist bowed himself out of the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>The President has a peculiar power of inspiring confidence in all
who approach him. In the summer-time it is the custom for the
National Band of the Marine Barracks to play alternately at the
Capitol and in the President's grounds. Crowds of citizens, with
senators and representatives accompanying the ladies of their families,
walk through the grounds while the band is playing, salute
their acquaintances and chat with their friends till the music ceases,
when they all, as the sun goes down, loiteringly leave. The President
and his family always appear on the portico that fronts on the
grounds of the White House, to which steps ascend from both sides,
and receive their friends and acquaintances, who call on these occasions
to pay their respects to the Chief Magistrate and his household.
His manners are so very unpretending that, but for the respect that
is paid him, you would not distinguish the Chief Magistrate from the
group among which he familiarly mingles, unless you were an
observer of character, and then you would know him from the
absence of all restraint in his person and conversation, and the freedom
and entire frankness of his intercourse with those around him.</p>

<p>On one of these Saturday afternoons, two countrymen, who
looked like persons who had come to market, approached the portico,
evidently with a desire to see the President. One of them asked a
gentleman who was ascending the steps, which was the President.
The gentleman pointed out the Chief Magistrate, and asked the
countryman if he would like to be introduced to him.</p>

<p>'Why,' replied the countryman, 'I am not of his way of thinking,
but they say so much about him and against him, that I should like
to have a good look at him, any how.'</p>

<p>'Come up; he 'll be glad to see you. Won't your friend come?'</p>

<p>The friend declined; and the gentleman with his new acquaintance
beside him, who gave him his name, ascended the steps. The
President instantly noticed the countryman, and observed that the
visiter felt some diffidence in approaching him. Mr. Tyler accordingly
quit the group by which he was surrounded, and advanced to
meet him. On his name being mentioned, the President gave him
a hearty shake of the hand, and asked him from what State he
came?</p>

<p>The countryman replied, from Virginia.</p>

<p>The President entered into conversation with him, and they stood
talking together some ten minutes or more, when with a smiling
countenance, and a frank offering of his hand, the visiter withdrew.</p>

<p>'There,' said the President, as the visiter left, 'is a man who,
consulting the native manliness of his impulses, has a propriety of
deportment that is better than any thing that Chesterfield has taught.
He is one of Nature's noblemen.'</p>

<p>After hearing this remark, the introducer was anxious to know
what impression the President had made upon a political opponent,
who had made such an impression upon the President. He accordingly
followed him as he walked away with his friend, who had
waited below.</p>

<p>He was persuading his friend to go up and be presented to the
President, and his introducer overheard him say:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>'I tell you what it is, neighbor, I believe they lie about him faster
than Eclipse can run.'</p>

<p>The President is truly a republican. He is often heard to express
the loftiest sentiments of patriotism in his family circle, when he
can have no purpose of popularity in view, but merely the wish to
give utterance to his feelings. A visiter at the White House
remembers well on one occasion, being then the only guest, when
the Rhode Island difficulties were in their midst, when some one
laughingly asked him, 'how he would like to be a King?' The
reply was: 'I am afraid, in spite of my democracy, that I should
say what the king of Prussia said to Doctor Franklin, that were he
in the Doctor's situation he would be a republican too; but being
born a king, he was determined to support king-craft.'</p>

<p>The President, who was gazing out of the window, and as it was
thought not at all attending to the idle talk, turned quickly round
and said with animation:</p>

<p>'I would rather settle the Rhode Island question upon the true
principles of the constitution, establish a just treaty with Great
Britain, and give my administration an honorable place in the history
of the republic, than win and wear the most princely crown in
christendom.'</p>

<p>The jokes between Mr. <span class="smcap">Wise</span> and the President are often very
amusing. Mr. Wise is the devoted friend of the President. The
representative from Virginia drives a little one-horse carriage, and
one day the President observed to him:</p>

<p>'Wise, that carriage of yours looks like a candle-box on wheels;
why don't you get a more genteel one?'</p>

<p>'Why, Mr. President, it is a much more genteel one than yours.
You keep four horses, which you don't drive more than once a
month; and when you do, you hitch them to a second-hand carriage.'</p>

<p>'Why, Wise, how did you find that out?'</p>

<p>'Find it out? Didn't you drive it about for a month, with the
coat of arms of Mr. <span class="smcap">Paulding</span>, late Secretary of the Navy upon it?'</p>

<p>'What of that? Is not Paulding the real Simon Pure of the
democracy?'</p>

<p>'Democracy blazoning its coat of arms!' replied Wise. 'I was
really glad one day when I stopped at the carriage-maker's to get
my truly republican vehicle mended, to see the ex-secretary's carriage
there, and a workman employed erasing the coat of arms;
making a plain pannel for your excellency.'</p>

<p>'Well,' replied the President, 'I claim to be descended from Wat
Tyler, the blacksmith, and I had better have a good stout arm grasping
an uplifted hammer, blazoned on my pannel; don't you think
so? It would be a real democratic knock-down to Paulding's heraldry.'</p>

<p>Speaking of the President's carriage, reminds me of an anecdote
of his coachman, Burrell. Somebody asked Burrell which he liked
best, Virginia or Washington?</p>

<p>'Virginia,' replied Burrell. 'I think there are more gentlemen in
Virginia, Sir, than there are about Congress. In Virginia, Sir, if a
gentleman wanted to abuse the President, he wouldn't come right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
by his carriage, where I, his coachman, am sitting, to talk it out so
as I can hear it. I, Sir, I've waited on him ever since he was first
married; I ought to know what kind of a man he is; and the way
they lie about him makes me so savage sometimes, that I feel as if
I'd like to have some on 'em tied to a tree, and have fair play at 'em
with this horse-whip.'</p>

<p>This anecdote is enough to show what kind of a master the President
is.</p>

<p>When Pettrick the sculptor was stabbed by some midnight assassin,
as soon as the President heard of it he hurried to his studio,
where the deed was perpetrated, and not only ordered him to be
provided for, but saw him attended to himself.</p>

<p>One Sunday just after dinner, there were several loud ringings of
the front door bell, when the President, who had left a gentleman
alone in the dining-room, returned and said: 'They have it through
the city that I have been shot!'</p>

<p>'With paper bullets of the brain, I suppose they mean, Mr. President,'
said the guest.</p>

<p>'No,' replied the President, 'with leaden bullets from a pistol.
Come, walk out on the portico, and smoke your cigar.'</p>

<p>The President with his guest walked out on the portico, whither
soon came thronging a crowd of the President's friends, who, hearing
the report through the city, had hastened to the White House to
learn if there was any truth in the story.</p>

<p>There was no truth whatever in it; but every body present was
struck with the President's indifference to the report, and the
absence of all curiosity on his part as to how it originated. He only
remarked: 'If I am shot at, gentlemen, it will be more in malice
than in madness;' and apologizing, by saying that daily confinement
required that he should take exercise, he rode away in his carriage
unattended.</p>

<p>As a husband and a father, President Tyler is a model for any
man; and particularly for public men, who too often neglect their
families. For a very long time the lady of the President was in
feeble health, which terminated in her death last summer. It was
a beautiful moral spectacle to see the President, amidst all the
cares and perplexities of his exalted station, beset by so many
detractors, so devotedly watchful of Mrs. Tyler's declining condition.
In the midst of the veto days, when engaged in the most animated
political conversation, if Mrs. Tyler chanced to be in the room,
the President's eye every minute wandered to her, in affectionate
regard; and when she left the room upon the arm of her son or
daughter, he would watch her anxiously and in silence till she withdrew,
and would often remain in melancholy thoughtfulness for
minutes afterward, forgetful of the conversation and those around
him.</p>

<p>In bringing up his family, Mr. Tyler has been fortunate. His
daughters, except the youngest, Alice, who is at school, are happily
married, and his sons who are grown, Mr. Robert and Mr. John
Tyler, are gentlemen of honor, manliness, and intellect; and Tazwell,
his youngest son, is a lad of promise. Miss Elizabeth Tyler,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
who is now Mrs. Waller, and living with her husband in Virginia,
was much admired in her bellehood when in the White House.
Her unpretending and gentle manners inspired with admiration all
who approached her.</p>

<p>'Well,' exclaimed a fashionably ambitious young lady one day to
a gentleman who was attending her on a visit to Miss Tyler, 'if I
were Miss Tyler, I'd blaze my bellehood out as long as my father
was President, and make the most devoted lover in christendom
bide my beck in the crowd.'</p>

<p>The fair Virginian had no such ambition, and thereby proved herself
worthy of the manly heart that has won her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Robert Tyler</span>, the eldest son of the President, is a young man
of brilliant genius. As a poet, in high-wrought and vivid imagery,
he resembles Shelley, whose likeness he personally resembles; and
as an orator, there is not a speaker of his years in our country who
has made a greater impression than he made in two extemporaneous
efforts before the Irish Association. Bold, eloquent, and
manly, he dashes into his subject with his whole soul, while comprehensiveness,
energy, and point characterize every thing he says.</p>

<p>Certain persons, forgetting the decencies of life, have abused and
calumniated Mr. Robert Tyler in the most gross and libellous manner.
It is therefore due to him to say, that a kinder son, a more
devoted husband and father, or a firmer friend, those who know him
have never known. Magnanimous and chivalrous, he throws no
veil over either his actions or opinions; and his frank and high bearing
wins the regard of all those who come in personal contact with
him, however much they may have been before prejudiced against
him.</p>

<p>The lady of Mr. Robert Tyler does the honors of the White
House. She is the grand-daughter of the late Major Fairlie, of
New-York, a soldier of the revolution, and a distinguished citizen,
who was well known to many of the oldest inhabitants of that city.
Her mother was a celebrated belle, whom our present minister to
Spain, Washington Irving, remembers vividly as his friend, and one
of the most brilliant women of the day; a fair and witty and most
worthy lady, who might well have inspired the author of the
'Sketch Book' with those exalted perceptions of female character
which glow so brilliantly in his portraits of the sex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>, the celebrated tragedian, married this lady, and Mrs.
Tyler is their eldest daughter. Three years since Miss Cooper
married Mr. Robert Tyler. Dickens says when he visited the
White House, that Mrs. Tyler 'acted as the lady of the mansion,
and a very interesting, graceful, and accomplished lady too.'</p>

<p>The just perception of Dickens understood at once the character
of Mrs. Tyler. She does the duties of the White House with a
graceful naturalness that is remarked by every one, and she combines
with a keen perception of character, an acute sense of the
ridiculous and a ready wit, the most feminine gentleness of manner
and deportment; qualities which are rarely found in combination.
Mrs. Tyler is devoted to her children, and she dresses them as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
plainly as if they were dwellers on a retired estate in Virginia.
Her own attire is simple, and she never departs from this simplicity
except when state occasions demand some little ornament. The
greatest sense of propriety marks her whole deportment in every
relation of life.</p>

<p>Mrs. Robert Tyler is now on a visit to a married sister in Alabama;
for another beautiful trait of her character is her devotion to her sisters
and brother. The only inmates of the White House at present
(May first) are the President with his three sons, and Mrs. Jones,
his eldest daughter. Mrs. Semple, the President's second daughter,
is living in Virginia, and is a lady of great beauty, and in the bloom
of health.</p>

<p>The fine features of Mrs. Jones are wan with long illness. She
never leaves her room except on some balmy day, to take a short
ride. The President always accompanies her, supporting her in his
arms to and from her chamber to the carriage, with a tenderness as
gentle and as watchful as her own to her babe. The President,
unlike some distinguished statesmen of other as well as of our
times, is remarkable for his high estimate of female character. He
receives the lady visiters of the White House with a deference and
respect which has been much noticed, and which is not the manner
of a worldling and a courtier, compliment and hollowness, but the
impulse of a lofty and holy sentiment. When a lad at school, he
prepared as a theme for declamation an essay upon female education,
in which the boy expressed those opinions which have ever
since been entertained by the man.</p>

<p>The President is a man of the strongest sympathies. There is
not a human being about him, from his servants to his children, of
whose feelings he is not regardful, and in whose welfare he does
not feel a daily and living interest. If the day be cool, he will ask
his coachman why he has not his overcoat. If his servant happens
not to be cheerful, he will ask him, in the kindest manner, what's
the matter with him. And the complaint, if the servant have one,
is made without the least hesitation, and with the certainty that he
will meet at the President's hands both sympathy and justice. In
his intercourse with his servants he is always kind, and frequently
jocular, for he is a great lover of a harmless jest.</p>

<p>A few weeks since, the Irishmen of the Capitol waited on the
President in a body, and through Mr. Hobson, their orator, expressed
their gratitude for the interest he had taken in them, and their profound
respect for his character, to which the President made a most
eloquent reply.</p>

<p>It was amusing to watch the interest which the President's servants,
all of whom belong to him, except Wilkins, the butler of the
establishment, and his son, felt in his speech. They modestly took
their station by the door, to listen to their master's reply, for they
are devotedly attached to him.</p>

<p>'Short,' asked a gentleman, of one of these humble listeners,
'how did you like the President's speech?'</p>

<p>'I always likes the President's speeches, Sir, but I don't think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
this one of his happiest efforts. I prefers him, Sir, before a jury.
He can beat any man in Virginia, before a jury,' was the reply.</p>

<p>The President's love for Virginia is truly worthy of a mother,
whose 'jewels are her children.' He delights in telling anecdotes
of his early days, in Virginia; and he always has the most cordial
greeting for his old Virginia friends, however humble they may be,
when they call to see him. How is such and such a one? he will
inquire, from the humblest laborer on a farm, up to the highest
dignitary of the State.</p>

<p>President Tyler is a man of very unsuspicious nature, and there
is no morbidity of feeling in him. He is always cheerful and
natural. In the midst of great difficulties of state, when the
Cabinet have held protracted meetings, and when, doubtless, there
were differences of opinion among them; when the Secretary of
State, with his beetling brows and cavernous eyes, passed by alone,
absorbed in his own thoughts; when Mr. Spencer's quick step lost
some of its elasticity, and the frank and firm Kentuckian, at the
head of the Post Office Department, wore an anxious look; and the
Attorney-General forgot, for a moment, his courteous salutation to a
friendly passer-by; when that true statesman of the old Virginia
school, Judge Upshur, seemed involved in what those who have not
the mind to comprehend him, call 'abstractions;' and when Mr.
Forward looked as if the cares of the Church, as well as those of
the Treasury were resting on his shoulders; the President would
pass from their midst to his family circle, assembled for dinner,
greet most cordially, and apparently without a care, whatever
person might chance to be their guest, and mix in the cheerful chat
around him, as if he had no thought but the wish to promote it.</p>

<p>The President is a statesman with no secret opinions. He
speaks out plainly whatever he thinks; and he listens respectfully,
nay, kindly, to the adverse opinions of others, without the least
spirit of dictation.</p>

<p>He is not the least of a formalist. If he has a guest, whom he
asks to take a glass of wine with him, he will himself search for
the keys of the side-board, if the servant happens to be absent,
produce the decanters and glasses himself, and tell some pleasant
story the while. When he talks of men, he speaks of their worth,
and seldom of their wealth. With his purse he is too open, and
too often he bestows more than his means warrant, upon some
needy applicant, for whom he can find no office, or whom he may
think unfitted for one.</p>

<p>For the President his family have the most unbounded love.
The only restraint they know, is what they think he would not
approve; and their familiar talk among themselves is never
checked, in the least, by his entrance; it is, on the contrary,
promoted.</p>

<p>These little personal traits of President Tyler and his family,
which might be easily extended into a volume, are offered to the
readers of the <span class="smcap">Knickerbocker</span> as being not without interest, since
they illustrate the private character of the Chief Magistrate of our
great Republic, and with the assurance that they are strictly true.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_MAIL_ROBBER" id="THE_MAIL_ROBBER">THE MAIL ROBBER.</a></h2>

<h3>NUMBER TWO.</h3>

<p class="center">TO THE EDITOR OF THE 'KNICKERBOCKER.'</p>


<p>'<span class="smcap">Sir</span>: At a prayer-meeting held in the house of a friend of mine,
in Bleecker-street, one of our most respectable and talented financiers,
and who was connected with myself in the late Post-office
transaction, of which I have favored you with a development, I was
thunder-struck at being shown the last number of your somewhat
amusing but reckless Magazine.</p>

<p>'My friend is a subscriber of yours, and was of course greatly
agitated and offended at the unexpected and astounding disclosure
of the private affair which you have so unwarrantably dished up for
the public. As was very natural, he charged me with the authorship
of that communication; and as a man of conscientious principle
and high moral sense, I was of course unable to deny it. By
this time the other gentlemen, our colleagues in said Post-office
business, one of whom is in Bangor, the other in Texas, have probably
seen the article in question; and you will perceive that I am
thus made, through your violation of the sanctity of correspondence,
to stand with them in the odious light of an informer.</p>

<p>'Sir, I supposed that your common perception of what is due to
the ordinary courtesies of epistolary intercourse rendered it unnecessary
for me to desire you not to publish any thing of a personal
nature. What is to become of our '<em>areas</em> and <em>focus</em>,' of our altars
and fires? what is to become of the bonds of social faith, the cherished
sentiments of domestic communion, the implicit confidence
between man and man, if delicate matters of peculiar and single
interest are thus to be blurted by an unreflecting conductor of a
journal into the face of all mankind and half New-York? To use
the emphatic expression of the western settler, who returned from
hunting to find his house and family rifled, (rifled in both senses,)
and the walls of his cabin plastered with the brains of his wife and
children, it is 'a little too ridiculous.'</p>

<p>'The mischief, however, is done, and is past recall. The least
you can do is to make what pecuniary compensation you consider
due to my outraged sensibilities. Your Magazine is reputed to be
profitable, and for the pile of correspondence which I have placed
at your disposal the remuneration ought to be generous. I am no
judge of poetry, but the quality of the article which I have sent you
I have several times heard spoken of as <em>first-rate</em>.</p>

<p>'If you will enclose a draft through the post to the address of
'A. B. C. D. E. F.,' a portion of the fund shall go to soothe the lacerated
feelings of my friend in Bleecker-street, and the rest shall be
devoted to charitable purposes, or to the temperance cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>'I had intended to write more fully upon this very vexatious subject,
but as the ladies are waiting for me to attend a revival at the
Tabernacle this evening, you must allow me to subscribe myself,</p>

<p class="center">
'Yours, truly mortified, &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;.'
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Fearless</span> in the discharge of our duties to the public, as an 'able
editor,' we have no hesitation in following the example of all able
editors, and give to our readers whatever we think will be considered
as a fair part of their money's worth. It is very odd that our sensitive
correspondent, so keenly alive to the sufferings of his friend,
the talented but lacerated financier of Bleecker-street, does not see
that the same sympathy which he insists upon would equally apply
to the persons abroad, whose letters he has 'so unwarrantably' made
public. This, however, is in the true spirit of the age, which is so
remarkably obtuse to that proverbial fact in natural history, that the
same sauce which suits the female gander is equally adapted to the
male goose.</p>

<h2><a name="LITERARY_NOTICES" id="LITERARY_NOTICES">LITERARY NOTICES</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Travels in Egypt, Arabia Petrea, and the Holy Land.</span> By Rev. <span class="smcap">Stephen Olin</span>, D. D.,
President of the Wesleyan University. With twelve Illustrations, on Steel. New-York:
<span class="smcap">Harper and Brothers.</span></p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> descriptions of the Eastern hemisphere, by enlightened American travellers, are
the richest contributions to our native literature; and especially the pictures of Western
Asia and Egypt, with which the constant perusal of the Bible has already made us
familiar. Hence, the principle declared by Dr. <span class="smcap">Olin</span> in his preface is undeniable:
'An unexceptionable book of oriental travels is a commentary upon the Bible, whose
divine teachings derive from no other source illustrations so pleasing, so popular, and so
effective.' This statement is true, not only of the erudite researches made expressly to
elucidate the apparent difficulties in the sacred volume, but also of the unpretending
notices of the visiter who merely records the objects as they passed before his eyes, and
the actual impressions derived from the scenes as he surveyed them. From the first
publication of that pioneer work, '<cite>Harmer's Observations</cite>,' through all its successors of the
same character, the result has been identical; the evidence has been progressively
cumulative, to verify the infallible accuracy of the historical details connected with the
scriptural archæology; and to American citizens probably the illustrations of antiquity,
especially of Palestine, Egypt, and the intermediate Deserts, are the most acceptable;
because our native travellers have none of the prejudices and prepossessions with which
almost all the European monarchists, and especially those of Britain, are trammelled;
and the anti-Asiatic citizens of this republic inspect the 'modern antiques' of the old
countries through a medium of original freshness and simplicity, which give to their
narrative a peculiar naïveté and vividness, evidently distinguished from the impressions
on the minds of Europeans. The correctness of this position is obvious on all the pages
of Dr. <span class="smcap">Olin's</span> interesting volumes; and while he has expressly and designedly excluded
all exhibitions of 'critical, philological, and antiquarian learning,' he has yet given us a
work which, instead of satiating the desire to know the character of Egypt, Arabia
Petrea, and the Holy Land, produces an earnest solicitude for a more extensive and
profound acquaintance with those countries, with which all our loftiest mental and
devout associations are inseparably conjoined.</p>

<p>It is not an easy task to specify any particular passages which require distinct notice,
in volumes where all is so excellently adapted to interest and edify; but we may remark
that Dr. <span class="smcap">Olin's</span> disquisition on <span class="smcap">Mohammed Ali</span> is the best article that we have seen
on that topic. Every pure sensibility of the heart is awakened, as we peruse the writer's
transcript of his emotions and reminiscences while roaming along the Red Sea; as he
read the decalogue on Mount Sinai; studied the prophecies concerning Edom at Petra;
contemplated 'the cave in the field of Macphelah;' chanted the songs of <span class="smcap">David</span> at
Bethlehem; surveyed the 'Potter's field;' 'fell among thieves' near Jericho; bathed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
over the ruins of 'Sodom and Gomorrah;' walked in the garden of Gethsemane; and
explored 'the city of the great King.' From all those subjects, lucid passages of great
pathos and elegance might be cited to recommend Dr. <span class="smcap">Olin's</span> volumes.</p>

<p>The decisively emphatic testimony which he has given to the dignified character and
the noble qualifications of <em>all</em> the American Protestant missionaries, is of the highest importance
and value, and constitutes a very forcible recommendation of his excellent work
to every patriot and philanthropist. It is proper also to add, that the amiable spirit and the
expansive benevolence which it every where developes, render it as grateful as it is
instructive and refreshing. We cannot, however, better express our judgment of
Dr. <span class="smcap">Olin's</span> volumes, than in a sentiment from his own preface: 'Whether considered
in reference to the intellectual tastes and habits produced or fostered by this species of
reading, or to the doubtful or pernicious character of the lighter literature which it may
supersede, every simple and true account of foreign countries, of their physical or moral
peculiarities, manners, institutions, and historical monuments, and of their intellectual
and economical condition, brings a valuable contribution to the best interests of education,
good morals, and public happiness.' Without doubt such will be the benign effects
of the work before us, wherever it is introduced. It will both extend very useful
knowledge, and exert a most salutary influence among all who peruse it. Therefore
we may hope, to adopt again our author's own language, that 'the fruits of his weakness
and affliction will promote the cause which is so dear to his heart,' by the circulation of
his travels among Bible classes and Sabbath schools, so that his 'highest ambition may
be gratified,' and that 'good reward of his labors' be returned to him in ample abundance,
for his perennial enjoyment.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">A Memoir of the Construction, Cost, and Capacity of the Croton Aqueduct: Compiled
from Official Documents:</span> together with an Account of the Civic Celebration of the Completion
of the Great Work, etc. By <span class="smcap">Charles King</span>. In one volume, royal quarto, pp. 306.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">King</span>, by the production of this elaborate work, has linked his name with one of
the most grand and beneficent enterprises of the present century, and the fame of which
will be perpetuated so long as the Croton river courses through our streets, or bursts in
its freshness from a thousand hydrants, or surges into the serene sky from hundreds of
fountains. We can well believe that the extent and variety of research, and the perspicuous
collation of relevant facts, which this work exhibits, are the result of a toil which
could have been to the author none other than a 'labor of love' for the renown of 'the
city of his birth and his affections.' Indeed there is nothing omitted, which could add to
the interest or value of the book. A preliminary essay presents us with a cursory but
clear and well-arranged examination and description of the chief ancient and modern
aqueducts, as well as of the devices for supplying themselves with water, in use among
the earliest peoples. The memoir of the Croton Aqueduct is in all respects complete
and authentic; and includes, we are glad to perceive, a sketch of the numerous attempts
which, from an early day, were made by the citizens of our metropolis to insure a supply
of pure and wholesome water. The principal public water-works of other cities and
towns of the United States are not forgotten: a general description of them leaves nothing
in this regard to be desired. That this excellent record of our crowning glory as a city
will attain a wide metropolitan and State circulation, it would be unjust even to doubt; but
it should do more; it should be in the hands of the citizens of <em>other</em> cities all over the Union.
Emulation of a great local good may thus be stimulated, as well as that just pride of
<em>country</em>, which every addition to our public enterprises is so well calculated to inspire.
The volume, which is printed with great luxury of type and paper, is embellished with a
fine steel engraving of the Croton dam, and three or four minor illustrations. The dedication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of the book to the people of New-York, and their representatives in the successive
Common Councils, is brief, forcible, and in good taste. In short, the work is an honor
alike to the city and to the author.</p>

Publisher.</p></blockquote>

<p>Six numbers of this exceedingly beautiful publication are before us; and we hazard
little in saying, that when completed it will form one of the most elegant volumes of a
kindred character that has ever been produced in this country. The whole work will
be concluded in twenty semi-monthly numbers, or within six months from the present
time. The illustrations consist of vignettes of a beautiful character and design, and of sacred
subjects, from the works of the first masters, adapted to the Epistles and Gospels, and the
Psalter. That these will be tasteful and appropriate, may be inferred from the fact that
their arrangement and adaptation are confided to the capable supervision of the accomplished
editor. The greater part of them will be selected from the English edition of
the Pictorial Prayer Book; many others, however, will be added from original drawings,
prepared expressly for the work, by Mr. J. G. <span class="smcap">Chapman</span>. Thus far, they have been
engraved in a masterly manner, reflecting additional beauty upon the clear letter-press
and pure white paper by which the emulous printer is perpetuating the remembrance of
his care and skill. 'As an appropriate companion for the work, Dr. <span class="smcap">Wainwright</span> will
prepare a history of the Liturgy, together with a commentary upon the text and rubrics.
This work will be embellished with designs having special reference to the church in
this country. It will be comprised in twenty numbers. The whole will form two
handsome volumes in royal octavo. Either of these volumes may, however, be taken
independently of the other, so arranged as to be bound in a single volume.' The cost of
the numbers is but thirty-one cents each! The enterprise has received the warmest
eulogiums and recommendations from the entire clergy of New-York and Brooklyn, as
well as from the clergy and laymen of other States.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> regard Mr. <span class="smcap">Whittier</span> as one among the very first of our poets. With one or
two eminent exceptions, no one of our best writers excels him in the melody of his verse,
and the appositeness and beauty of his imagery. There is, moreover, a depth of feeling, an
earnestness and ardor, visible in his later writings, which sufficiently distinguish him
from the herd who write verse as they would write an advertisement; stimulated, too
often it may be, by the same impulse in the one case as in the other. Mr. <span class="smcap">Whittier</span>
never sits down with a pen in his hand and a sheet of foolscap before him, to 'pump
up a feeling' touching some pliable theme or another, as to the precise nature of which
he is either entirely ignorant or quite undecided. How many of our rhymists, miscalled
poets, differ from our friend in this! Sitting down with a desperate determination to get
up an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">afflatus</i>; to write, and to rhyme, at all events; to secure the requisite number of
feet and the required number of necessary lines; is a process of composition which can
never result in the production of poetry. A goodly proportion, and the best parts (evidently
so deemed by the writer, who has given them the place of honor) of the volume
before us appeared originally in the <span class="smcap">Knickerbocker</span>. Much of the remainder, although
not now first published, will be new to many of our readers, to all of whom we cordially
commend Friend <span class="smcap">Whittier</span>'s neat and tastefully-executed volume.</p>

<h2><a name="EDITORS_TABLE" id="EDITORS_TABLE">EDITOR'S TABLE</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Early Writings of the late R. C. Sands: Third Notice.</span>&mdash;Through the continued
kindness of the co-member of the 'Literary Confederacy,' of which the lamented
<span class="smcap">Sands</span> was so bright an ornament, we are enabled to set before our readers another Salmagundi
from that gifted writer's facile pen. We have lately touched in these pages
upon the character and proceedings of the early Puritans; and as a pleasant illustration
of their peculiar views, manners, and customs, we shall venture to select a few passages
from '<cite>Salem Witchcraft, an Eastern Tale</cite>,' in which <span class="smcap">Sands</span>'s love of the ludicrous and
the burlesque is forcibly exhibited. The era of the story is that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">annus mirabilis</i>, 1692;
the scene the town of Salem, (Mass.,) into which a stranger, mounted on a charger,
descended from John of Gaunt's ploughing team, enters at a devout gait. This is <span class="smcap">Faithful
Handy</span>, an ordained teacher of the Word, who has 'a recommend' from a reverend
brother to <span class="smcap">Deliverance Hobbes</span>; which 'recommend' in some degree superseded the
formalities of courtship in those primitive days. Miss <span class="smcap">Hobbes</span> was no Hebe, if we may
judge from this sketch of her person and features, taken as she turned round, while drawing
water at a well, to reconnoitre the new comer: '<span class="smcap">She</span> squinted in the peculiar mode
described by the poet, 'when one eye looked up, the other looked down;' and was terribly
deformed in her person. Nature, in elaborating this rare article, seemed to have
been trying an optical experiment; as if to show, by adapting her crooked figure to a
parabolical reflector, how symmetry may be produced from the most hideous and uncouth
distortion. Her head, shaped like a broad-axe, was garnished with a tuft of red wool,
which 'streamed like a meteor to the troubled air,' and would, if transplanted, like the
locks of Berenice, have affrighted the nations, threatening pestilence and war. Her green
eyes were set deep in her head, and seemed affected, like the grass, by the hot weather.
A huge hawked nose covered half her face. Her ears were set like a dog's in the back
of her head; and her broad concave cheeks were rivelled with seams, stigmatized with
scars, and riddled with the small-pox. Thin skinny lips, and a Bavarian poke of the chin,
completed the nomenclature of her charms; and the rest of her person tallied with her
face. Such was the dragon that answered in a shrill voice to the parson's inquiries, 'Yes,
Deliverance Hobbes lives here; and I am her daughter Beautiful!' This was confirmed
by the apparition of the matron herself; who was the exemplar of her daughter's attractions,
except that her own charms had become mellowed by age, and contrary to the
usual course of nature, matured into something rather less ghastly and horrible. She
seemed to be informed of the purport of her visiter's mission; for her first inquiry was:
'Be you the minister that's got a recommend from Hugh Peters?' Faithful groaned in
the spirit, as he replied, he was; and as he entered the house, could not repress an inward
ejaculation: 'Hugh Peters had not ought to have did this! The Lord deliver me from
Deliverance Hobbes, and the Gorgon, her beautiful daughter!' <span class="smcap">Deliverance</span> expresses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
her willingness that the preacher should 'keep company with her daughter Beautiful,' in
which the latter acquiesces, with a supernatural leer; whereat the preacher is greatly
perturbed. 'She is too bitter ornary!' he exclaims, mentally; and even a plentiful
repast of bread, butter, milk, hominy, pork, sweet-meats, pumpkin-pie, and onions, cannot
blind him to <em>that</em> fact; hence he makes an excuse to depart for a brief season, to
visit his friend Goody <span class="smcap">Mercy Peabody</span>, who lives hard by, promising soon to return:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Goody Peabody</span> was very glad to see Faithful, whom she had not beheld before since he was
a child; and he was much pleased with her daughter Patience, who was the very reverse of
Beautiful Hobbes; being a healthy, clean-limbed, tidy, good-natured looking housewife. He
now learned that Beautiful was as <em>ugly</em> as she was <em>bitter</em>; being a vast virago, and an intolerable
slut. In short, it was soon settled that he should keep company with Patience, and let Beautiful
shift for herself. As soon as Faithful had left the mansion of Goody Hobbes, which he did as fast
as fear and his horse could carry him, the damsel whom he thus uncourteously shunned, having
devoured him and his charger with her eyes, till they were out of the sphere of their vision, incontinently
swallowed the remaining segment of the pumpkin-pie to which he had paid his most earnest
devoirs, and waddled off to her dressing-room, to adorn her person for his expected return.
In about half an hour she made her reäppearance in the parlor, which had been in the mean while
swept and garnished. But not as she went out did Beautiful now return. She had exchanged
the dishabille in which she was accustomed to perform her domestic duties for the whole paraphernalia
of her toilet; and she now appeared arrayed in shreds and patches of as many different
colors as are found in the neck of a turkey-cock, and loaded with every article of her wardrobe,
which she imagined could give zest to her appearance, or add intensity to her charms. Her fiery
locks, condensed to a focus, and curiously entwined with a green riband, much resembled a bunch
of carrots dextrously garnished with grass. Her crooked carcase had been, in some measure,
straightened by a pair of tight stays, which, reaching to her hips, prevented her, as she sat in a
high-backed chair, from making any other than gyral contortions. Goody Hobbes, who had also
paid some attention to her charms, sat opposite her daughter, admiring the second edition of her
own perfections. Admiration of themselves, and of each other, for a while kept the two paragons
silent. The elder at length broke forth: 'I guess it's high time for Faithful to be back.' To
which the younger replied, 'I guess so too.' Then says the elder Hobbes, 'I guess there an't no
witches and spectres at Punkapog-pond.' 'I guess there an't,' rejoined Beautiful. A long pause
now ensued, which was broken by the matron's observing, 'I admire what keeps Faithful so long
at Goody Peabody's.' 'I admire so too,' says Beautiful, who, from the bottom of her stays, spoke
like one from the tomb. 'I admire how ornary Patience Peabody is,' quoth Deliverance. 'I
admire at her too,' quoth Beautiful; 'how bitter she is! They say she has seen the black man.'
Another long pause ensued, during which the impatience of the couple manifested itself by agitations,
and writhings of their heads and extremities. Faithful not making his appearance, these
spasmodic affections increased to universal and horrible convulsions of their whole frames; and
they sat like two Pythonesses on their sacred stools, pregnant with inspiration, and looking unutterable
things. At length, in the midst of her paroxysm, Deliverance bounced from her seat,
exclaiming with vehemence, 'I notion to send Remarkable to see where the minister stays!'</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Remarkable Short</span>, a woman six feet in her stockings, and quite 'in keeping' with
the <span class="smcap">Hobbes</span> family, is despatched after Faithful by Deliverance, in these dulcet-words:
'Remarky, I wish you'd go down to Goody Peabody's and look after the minister that
ate supper here. I notion that he's forgot that it's time for him to come back and pray,
before we go to bed.' Remarkable and her errand were not very courteously received.
Goody Peabody said 'she admired what business such a long-shanked, ill-conditioned,
bitter-looking body as she, had to be snooping about other people's houses at that time of
night; that Faithful was going to keep company with her daughter <span class="smcap">Patience</span>; that
Remarkable had better return to her employer; adding, that if she didn't troop in less
than no time, she would see if her help, <span class="smcap">Preserved Perkins</span>, couldn't help her.'
Remarkable, after a series of adventures, arrives at home, and reports progress. Deliverance
and her daughter Beautiful receive the intelligence of the defection of the minister
in a paroxysm of anger and mortification; which ends in Beautiful's falling back in
violent contortions, exclaiming that she is 'bewitched by Patience Peabody!' The village
of Salem, it should be premised, was at this period in a woful state of perturbation,
if we may believe <span class="smcap">Cotton Mather</span>, who tells us that 'the devils were walking about
the streets with lengthened chains, making a dreadful noise in our ears; and brimstone,
even without a metaphor, was making a horrid and an horrible stench in our nostrils.
And whoever,' he adds, 'questions any of these things, I hold to be a person of peculiar
dirtiness.' If we may believe <span class="smcap">Mather</span>, therefore, the 'Prince of the Air' and his imps,
with an innumerable host of spectres, phantoms, apparitions, and hobgoblins, were let
loose upon this devoted place, and at the instigation of old women, potent in witchcraft,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
were playing their damned pranks upon the inhabitants. Some delighted to stick pins
and forks in the tender flesh of innocent babes. Others would grievously torment poor
damsels, buffeting and tossing them about in a most lamentable manner. Sometimes
they would cause the most serious and sober-minded persons to babble forth unutterable
nonsense in all the known languages of the earth, except the Iroquois, in the which, it is
said, the devil himself hath no skill. At others, they would excite the worthy townsmen,
yea, even the selectmen themselves, to cut the most strange and fantastic capers; performing
those evolutions which the Greeks call [Greek: kuzisan] and [Greek: ekkuzisan], now upon their
heads they would dance aërial hornpipes and fandangos; and anon going upon all fours,
they would bark like a pack of hounds, or bray like a troop of jack-asses. Beside this,
brutes, and even inanimate matter, were the subjects of wicked sorcery: gridirons,
shovels, and frying-pans, clattered and rang, though touched by no mortal hand; spits
before the fire would fly up the chimney in the twinkling of an eye, and anon coming
down again, stick in the back-log in a spiteful and portentous manner; and three-legged
stools, slipping on one side, would laugh to see the matron whom they had eluded, lie
sprawling on the ground. Naughty children would feign themselves bewitched by some
person against whom they had taken an antipathy, and would kick, sprawl, and bellow,
with wonderful agility, until they had succeeded in moving the tender hearts of judge
and jury, and had the satisfaction of seeing poor Irishwomen hanged, whom their brogue
convicted of infernal colloquies, or some poor old lady ducked and drowned, whom an
unlucky squint showed to be possessed of an evil eye. In short, the whole country was in
an eminently distressed and bedevilled predicament; and Beautiful Hobbes was a decided
victim. A universal twitching assailed her joints; a sheeted paleness usurped her smoke-dried
cheeks; the purple faded from the tip of her nose, and the color of her eyes
became a dingy yellow; and she exclaimed, amid sobs and hiccups, 'Mother, there is a
ball in my throat, and Patience Peabody hurts me!' And she continued to roar lustily,
and pray for deliverance from her tormentor. Early next morning the Justice of the
County Court is informed that there is a decided case of malignant witchcraft at Goody
Hobbes's, where he is wanted immediately, in his judicial capacity. Accompanied
therefore by the sheriff, and <span class="smcap">Cotton Mather</span> and his son, he straitway repairs to the
scene of bewitchment: 'When they arrived there, the room was full of people. Deliverance
and Remarkable were keeping guard on each side of the bed in which lay Beautiful,
who, as soon as the Justice entered, uttered a terrible screech, and fell into hysterics.
Mr. Mather junior then walked up to the bed, and passed his hand over the coverlid.
They asked him what he felt? He said there was something supernatural there, resembling
a rat, and quickly withdrew his fingers, having received a scratch quite across his
hand. The mob were now, by command of the Justice, turned out of the room, and Mr.
Mather senior made a prayer of half an hour's length; Deliverance every now and then
giving her daughter a spoonful of brandy, to keep her quiet. When the prayer was concluded,
Beautiful was told to say Amen; but she only made a muttering sort of noise,
which sounded more like an imprecation than any thing else. After many ineffectual
attempts, they gave over asking her to repeat the word; and the Justice asked her, 'Who
hurt her?' She then answered, glibly enough, 'Patience Peabody; she sticks pins in
me; and there is her spectre!' This was enough for the Justice, who ordered the sheriff,
in a magisterial tone, to seize and hold the body of Patience Peabody until farther notice,
at the same time calling out of the window to one of the crowd around the house, to go
down to Dr. <span class="smcap">Drybones</span>, and request his immediate presence. The messenger found that
worthy functionary taking his morning walk in the grave-yard which adjoined his dwelling.
'He was a lank, long-visaged figure, skinny and withered up in his person, and
who bore a considerable resemblance to one of his own dried preparations. One would
imagine from his appearance that he had become assimilated to the spot where he usually
perambulated; and where it was said he had sent the greater number of his patients, as
if to have them under his more immediate charge.' Dr. Drybones repairs forthwith to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the possessed mansion, in a parlor of which the Squire and the two Mathers are awaiting
him. After the first salutations, they all repair in a body to the chamber where
Beautiful was lying, engaged in her gymnastic exhibitions:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">The</span> Doctor, at the head of the 'posse comitatus,' advanced solemnly up to the bed-side, and
protruding his long skinny hand, took hold of the maiden's wrist between the fore-finger and
thumb, with the true Esculapian gripe. Then closing his eyes, and holding in his breath, as if to
condense all his sensibilities to the ends of his fingers, he began counting the pulsations. In about
half a minute he pronounced, in a solemn, sepulchral tone, at each pause pouting out his lips, and
smacking them in a curious manner: 'Pulse slow, and frequent; indicating a congestion of the
cerebrum, and general plethora, together with a phlogistic diathesis; you understand me, Squire.'
'Oh, perfectly, perfectly; exactly so, Doctor,' replied the Justice, putting on one of his wisest
looks; who, though he knew no more than a brewer's horse how a pulse could be slow and at
the same time frequent, and also how this indicated a congestion of the cerebrum, yet did not like
to confess his ignorance. 'And observe, Squire,' continued the Doctor, who had been lately reading
a work on Nosology, and wished to show off a little before the Justice, 'observe, I say, the
dilatation of the pupils, and the twitchings of the muscles, and the tossing of the extremities, and
the spasmodic affection of the diaphragm, and the tetanic symptoms; you understand me, Squire;
a very curious and complicated case, Squire.' The Justice, who at each stop in the Doctor's
speech, had put in his usual 'Just so; exactly so; satanic symptoms, no doubt, Doctor;' coincided
in this opinion. He also added that he had discovered the witch, and issued a warrant for her
apprehension. Mr. Mather senior now came forward, and with a sneering and sarcastic expression
of countenance, proposed, that as the Doctor understood the symptoms so well, he should
exert himself a little to relieve them; at the same time insinuating that drugs and doctors were
mere flea-bites, when opposed to witchcraft. 'Certainly,' replied the Doctor, in his deliberate
tones, 'certainly, friend Mather, I shall do to the utmost of my poor abilities to fulfil the nineteen
indications which offer. Of which the first is phlebotomy; the second a cleansing emetic; the
third a saline cathartic; the fourth a potent anti-spasmodic; the fifth a relaxing sodorifie; the
sixth&mdash;&mdash;' 'Now may Satan take both you and your nineteen indications!' interrupted Mather
senior, who was much offended by this pedantic and conceited speech; and whose indignation
was vehemently aroused by his being called 'friend Mather,' which he considered a downright
insult, he having a most horrible antipathy to Quakerism. 'I tell you what, Drybones,' continued
he, 'you are a person of a shallow wit, and small capacity for understanding these things; and
touching the wonders of the invisible world, I hold you to be little better than an ass. Here
Mather junior put in his oar, saying that Drybones was a quack, and an ignoramus, and that he
would not trust him to bleed his cow. Drybones, however, who possessed a happy share of equanimity,
and who prided himself upon his imperturbable countenance, paid no manner of regard
to these discourses; but pulling out an enormous fleam-lancet, and turning to the Justice,
exclaimed: 'Now by the blessing of God, will I open the jugular of this damsel!' Then calling
for three small porringers, and setting the spring of his lancet, the edge of which he tried upon
his thumb-nail, he advanced boldly up to the bed.'</p></blockquote>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Mathers</span> interposed, however, and 'prevented the effusion of blood;' it being
considered by the strict Puritans as much a matter of heresy for a doctor to interfere
with a case of witchcraft, as it is for a physician at the present day to treat one of canine
rabies by what is called 'regular practice.' The Justice and the <span class="smcap">Mathers</span>, after the
doctor had left the house, departed together, discussing on their way many serious topics
and profound questions concerning witchcraft, sorcery, enchantments, good and bad
spirits, apparitions, and such grave matters; in which the elder <span class="smcap">Mather</span> displayed so
much and such various learning upon his general theme, that it quite overpowered the
Justice; who at last interposed, saying, petulantly: 'Well, for my part I don't know
nothing about these things, and always did. A little law is all that I know.' The Squire
having arrived at home, is informed by the sheriff that he has Patience in custody; when,
accompanied by his 'divine friends,' the man of law proceeds with magisterial dignity to
his hall of justice, where he finds a great mob of people, and hears the dolorous shrieks
of sundry frantic-looking women, which he finds on inquiry to proceed 'from Abigail
Williams and her gossips, who are roaring out because Patience hurts them.' 'Ha!'
said the Justice, 'I begin to smell a rat. That Abigail Williams has borne testimony in
every case of witchcraft that has occurred in this town since the beginning of the troubles
thereof; and if she had been pinched, and pricked, and bruised, half so much as she says
she has, she must have been a corpse long ago.' 'Pray, young woman,' said he, addressing
himself to Patience; 'what is the matter with Beautiful Hobbes?' 'I do not know,'
said Patience; 'I reckon she is crazy.' 'But why does she cry out against you, for putting
the black man upon her?' 'I do not desire to spend my judgment thereon,' answered
she. The worthy magistrate seemed puzzled what to say next, and turning to Doctor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Mather, inquired, 'what was his judgment touching the question, whether the devil could
torment in the shape of a virtuous person?' Mather made answer, 'that he should be
proud to communicate his poor opinion thereof at a more seeming time; but held it best,
under correction, to proceed with the business in hand.' 'Well,' said the Squire, 'I
believe there is no more to be said. I must make out this young woman's mittimus, and
have her confined until the grand jury sit.' Faithful interposes for his lady-love, remonstrates
against her imprisonment, and offers to undertake to make Beautiful repent her
accusations before night, if he might be allowed a private interview with her; at which
proposition <span class="smcap">Mather</span> expressed himself shocked, and severely reproved Faithful for
desiring to have infernal communication with a woman accused of witchcraft. When
the Justice and his reverend guests had gone back to discuss the question, whether the
devil could torment in the shape of a good man, the crowd proceeded to the sheriff's
house, the women ranting, roaring, and screaming; the bedevilled Abigail Williams,
among the rest, walking as if afflicted by Saint Vitus, screeching in the most painfully
distressing tone, and ever and anon falling into apparent convulsions; the mob the while
mingling their groans and dolorous wailings, as if Pandemonium had broken loose in
good earnest, and Satan had come again upon the earth like a roaring lion. Meantime
Faithful bends his way to Dame Hobbes's, to remonstrate with the possessed Beautiful.
He reaches the mansion:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">With</span> a trembling hand he ventured to open the door, after he had knocked several times in
vain. Through the smoke which filled the apartment, he saw the elder female seated by the fireside,
with her chin resting on her palms, and a stump of a pipe in her mouth. Remarkable was
lying, seemingly dead drunk, upon the floor, and snoring like fifty bull-frogs; and Beautiful, in a
short gown and petticoat, was sitting on the side of the bed, discussing a large bowl of bean-soup.
The old woman took no notice of Faithful, but continued smoking her pipe with great sang-froid;
but the eyes of Beautiful twinkled with emotion at his appearance. With a mixed expression of
countenance, where pleasure and surprise at beholding the preacher curiously blended with the
bitter twist given her visage by the hot soup, she motioned him to sit down beside her. He obeyed
with the dubious air of one who seats himself with a half-formed resolution of suffering the
extraction of a grinder. She edged up to him, and asked him if he would have some soup; but
he declined the offer with a graceful wave of the hand, telling her that he came to have a little
private conversation with her. At this, Beautiful told him to say what he had to say, as Remarkable
was too drunk, and her mother too sleepy, to overhear him. The preacher now commenced
a long and animated expostulation with the damsel, on her conduct, in which he mingled threats
and promises, reproofs and entreaties, in a subtle and orator-like manner. Beautiful at first heard
him with great impatience, and seemed convulsed with inward emotion; now stifling a rising
sob, and now gulping down a spoonful of the soup. He at last seemed to hit upon an argument
that fixed her attention; for all at once she became quite calm, and as soon as he had finished,
wonderful to relate, promised to behave herself, and not be bewitched any more. Upon this he
departed, telling her that the Justice was coming in the evening to see how she did, and bidding
her be careful, and mind what he had told her.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Accordingly, when evening arrives, Faithful accompanies the Justice and the sheriff to
Goody Hobbes's mansion, which the 'visiting party' enter with faces as long and serious
as if they had come to a funeral. The Justice breaks silence, by asking Beautiful
how she finds herself, to which she responds, 'I notion I feel better this evening, and
am not bewitched any more.' 'Then,' quoth the Justice, 'I guess you was crazy this
morning.' 'I guess I was,' answers Beautiful. The final result is, that Patience Peabody
is liberated, and Remarkable Short and Preserved Perkins, who have 'conspired
against the general peace,' cut a remarkable figure in the stocks; where, being obliged
to endure each other's company for two hours side by side, they contracted an affection
for that position; 'their passions vacillated from the extreme of hate to that of love; a
sneaking partiality arose between them; Preserved afterward married Remarkable, and
a curious couple they were.' Faithful carried back his blooming bride, with whom he
lived a long life of peace and innocence. 'They had thirteen children; the first was
called Welcome, and the last Content; and their posterity inherit the land to this day.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> of our readers, who never had the good fortune to hear the elder <span class="smcap">Kean</span>, will
thank us for the annexed striking picture by <span class="smcap">Sands</span>, of his personation of Shylock, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
'The Merchant of Venice.' It was written for the 'Literary Journal,' a thin monthly
pamphlet, which closed its very brief existence some twenty-five years ago:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Kean</span>'s manner in the first part is that of the miserly, calculating Jew; and it is not until the
entrance of Antonio, that we suspect him of aught worse than usury. The sight of Antonio kindles
his hatred, and he exclaims, 'Cursed be my tribe, if I forgive him!' We tremble for the
merchant, and shudder, as with a sudden change of countenance he smooths the wrinkle of hate
from his brow, and turns to his victim with, 'Rest you fair, good Signior.' The speech in which
he recounts the bitter scorn, the personal indignities he has received from Antonio, was finely
given. It was not said entirely in anger; beneath his indignation could be discerned a malignant
pleasure; and when he said, 'Well, then, it now appears you need my help,' his eyes seemed to
flash with ferocious joy. The conciliating and jesting manner he assumed while settling the terms
of the contract, was admirable, and the performance of the whole scene was without a fault.
The passage most deserving praise, in the next act in which he appears, is the trembling eagerness
with which he receives the news of Antonio's loss, as he exclaims, almost breathless:
'What, what, what! Ill luck, ill luck?' And even, while in his impious rapture, he thanks God,
he still doubtingly asks, 'Is it true; is it true?' But it is in the trial scene that this gifted actor puts
forth his strength. With what an unmoved air he listened to the Duke's exhortation to be merciful!
His reply was not spoken with violence, in the loudness of anger, but with a horrid calmness in a
subdued but chilling manner; and he asked, 'Are you answered?' in a tone of bitter irony. So
fiendish a countenance we wish never to look upon, except when we know it is assumed, as when
he sharpened the ready knife, and cried with a serpent hiss, 'To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt
there!' We almost quaked before the glance of his demon eye, as he seemed to gloat upon
his victim. As he gazed on Antonio, his lips were slightly curled by the bitter smile of satisfied
malice; his eyes were bright and distended with the joy of his revengeful anticipations; yet he
neither spoke nor moved. We pass over many points, to notice his answer to Portia's suggestion, of
sending for a surgeon, lest Antonio bleed to death. 'Is it so nominated in the bond?' And the expression
with which he raises his eyes from the paper, and says, with a smile which a devil might own,
'I cannot find it&mdash;'tis not in the bond.' As the court proceeds to award the sentence in his favor,
his face becomes lighted by exultation; his whole form seems to throb with joy; he bares his hands,
and grasps the knife, with convulsive eagerness. But who can do justice to the sudden transition
of his manner, the horror-struck, doubting air, the fixed rigid countenance, with which he hears the
forbidding clause? When he finds utterance, it is but a sentence of four words which he pronounces.
But how are they pronounced! The fingers which had clenched the knife gradually
unloose their grasp, and fall nerveless and slowly by his side; the disappointed, dejected, almost
exhausted tone, in which he with difficulty articulates 'Is that the law?' Surely this was the
perfection of acting. We have beheld <span class="smcap">Cooke</span>'s representation of this character with delight, and
have dwelt upon it with pleasure. But, great as it was, compared to <span class="smcap">Kean</span>'s, it appears a cold
performance. Indeed, Mr. <span class="smcap">Kean</span> approaches nearer to <span class="smcap">Garrick</span> than any actor since his time.
<span class="smcap">Kemble</span> has more majesty; <span class="smcap">Cooke</span> possesses more physical power, and though not a good, yet
a finely-modulated voice. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span> has great advantages both of person and voice; but they are
all deficient in that astonishing variety of expression, that power of reaching men's hearts, and
causing them to tremble, which distinguishes Mr. <span class="smcap">Kean</span>.'</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Kean</span>'s power over the feelings of his audiences seems scarcely to have been surpassed
by any actor that ever trod the stage. Hosts of admirers speak of him even now
with unabated enthusiasm.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> subjoined beautiful reflections and yet more admirable poetry are from an essay
based oddly enough upon a version of one of the monosyllabic poems of <span class="smcap">Ausonius</span>; a
string of verses, in which the last monosyllable of each line forms the first of the next,
and the first is the same as the last; so that they may be read over and over again without
end. 'We take it,' writes <span class="smcap">Sands</span>, 'as a good motto for a paper which we mean to
write, without having any precise notion on what subject we shall descant. We mean
to make, on something or other, 'a few plain and practical remarks,' as the Rev.
Mr. &mdash;&mdash; says, when he means to preach a sermon five quarters of an hour long.' The
paper thus lightly commenced, closes as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'A <span class="smcap">MAN</span> who lives out his threescore and ten years, or lingers beyond that period, must, in the
common course of events, see the ordinary revolutions affected by time and death. At the middle
of his career, he sees a flourishing family around him; friends and connections formed in his
advancing course; attachments begun in sympathy, and cemented by interest. He lives on; and
his children are scattered by the accidents of mortality, and their graves are in different countries.
His friends have vanished from their former haunts, and the places that knew them, now know
them no more for ever. 'He asks of the solitudes, where are they? and the hollow echo answers,
Where?' There is no one to sympathize with his remembrances of the past; his infirmities
become a grievance, or he thinks them so, to those around him; and he still feels that lingering
attachment to life, which answers the philosopher's question, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">an mors malum sit</i>, with the powerful
evidence of consciousness. Hope and Memory delude the pilgrim in his journey, by the false
colors with which they paint the scene before and behind him. 'Man never is, but always to be
blest;' and as the future, depicted by the fancy only, presents unmingled visions of delight, the
past, mellowed by time, loses the little inconveniences which jarred discordantly with the passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
music of pleasure; and its remembrance makes us regret what when present we neglected. It
was under the influence of such reflections, that the following lines were composed. They were
written in a prophetic hour by one who died young, and willing to depart:</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Gossip from an American Lady in Paris.</span>&mdash;We derive the subjoined pleasant
gossip from a young and gifted American lady, at present resident in the French metropolis.
We hope to be similarly favored, whenever our fair correspondent shall find
leisure from the demands of society to transcribe her fresh 'jottings-down' for our pages:
'<span class="smcap">We</span> went to the Hotel des Invalides this morning to see the plans in relief of the fortified
towns of France. They are exhibited to the public only during one month in the
year. The plans of those cities I have visited interested me particularly. They are so
minute that Miss L&mdash;&mdash;, who accompanied us, had no difficulty in finding the country-house
near Toulon where she spent some months last year. I was much struck by the
plan of Embrun, in Dauphiny, that little town celebrated in both history and romance
by the pilgrimages so frequently made to it by devout Catholics. It is strongly fortified
and built on a rock of semi-circular form, which rises so perpendicularly on one side
from the meadows which lie below, that one would suppose it must have been hewn
away by the hand of man. I was much interested, too, by the plan of Mont St. Michel,
in Normandy, the celebrated prison, built on a rock, which the tide separates twice a
day from the main land, and where the political prisoners condemned after the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">émeuté</i>, in
May, 1839, are confined. We were looking at the plan of a fort, on the pedestal of which
the name had not been labelled as on the others, when a soldier standing near informed
us it was that of Ham, where the nephew of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> is now a prisoner. It is in
Picardy, which I am told is the most arid and unfruitful province in France. It is built
around a quadrangular court, or I should rather say there are three buildings and a terrace
which form a hollow square. The prince, who is said to be a remarkably good
horseman, is allowed to ride on this terrace, which is not shaded by trees; indeed, if
this plan be correct, which I suppose it must be, as it has just been made, there is but
one tree within the precincts of the fortress.... In the evening, my friend, Madame
D&mdash;&mdash; took me to the house of the Polish Princess <span class="smcap">Czartoryski</span>. Prince <span class="smcap">Adam
Czartoryski</span> is from his birth, his wealth, and his character, one of the most illustrious
of the Polish refugees. His life has been checkered by every extreme of good or ill.
In early youth, he served in the army of the republic of Poland. He was at one time
the captive of <span class="smcap">Catherine</span> II., and in 1831 was at the head of the provisional government
of Poland. After the total defeat of the Polish army, Prince and Princess <span class="smcap">Czartoryski</span>
with some difficulty made their escape, with their three children, the youngest
of whom was not a year old. The Princess had not even a change of linen with her,
and no time to collect her jewels, which were brought to her after she had reached the
Austrian frontier, by a soldier, whom she had never seen before, and who refused to tell
his name. It is impossible to imagine a greater contrast than that offered by the present
mode of life of the Prince and Princess, and the splendor by which they were formerly
surrounded. Prince <span class="smcap">Adam</span> was one of the richest proprietors, and possessed not one,
but several, of the most magnificent palaces in Poland, and was accustomed from childhood
to every comfort and luxury which wealth could devise. The house he now
inhabits is as simple as possible; but he remains at home every Monday evening for the
purpose of seeing his friends and countrymen; and his <em>salon</em> is always crowded with
the most learned men and most fashionable women in Paris. These weekly receptions
are attended with but very little expense here, as tea and lemonade are the only refreshments
it is the custom to offer. Prince <span class="smcap">Czartoryski</span> is a most venerable-looking man
of about seventy. The expression of his face is habitually melancholy, but at times he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
very animated in conversation. Like most Poles, he speaks low and very slowly. I
remarked that he was particularly polite and attentive to young people, which in a man,
who, from his various misfortunes and trials, can take but little interest in general society,
is, I think, very striking. The Princess, who must be almost thirty years younger
than the Prince, is very lady-like and prepossessing in her manners. She is much
beloved by her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">compatriotes</i>: her efforts to relieve those who are in distressed circumstances
being unceasing. She employs all her leisure hours in embroidering; and her
embroidery, which is more beautiful than any thing of the kind I have ever seen, is sold
at a bazar, which is opened during the last week of every year; new-year's day being
the time when the French make those presents to their friends which in England and in
our country are made on Christmas day. All the ladies of the Princess's acquaintance of
course contribute to her bazar; and those who are remarkable for their beauty or their
talents, are invited by her to keep the stalls. * * * <span class="smcap">Mrs.</span> B&mdash;&mdash;, whose son, a lad of
about sixteen, is now engaged in attending the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cours de religion</i>, or religious lectures of
M. <span class="smcap">Coquerel</span>, one of the clergymen of the Reformed Church of Paris, took me this
morning to hear one of the lectures. M. <span class="smcap">Coquerel</span> is the nephew of the celebrated
<span class="smcap">Helen Maria Williams</span>, by whom he was educated. He is the most eloquent, and I
believe the most learned, clergyman in Paris. I had been much pleased with his sermons,
and was therefore very glad to have an opportunity of hearing one of his lectures.
His class was composed of about thirty young men, of different ages, from sixteen to
twenty-five. He has written a little book called '<cite>Cours de Religion</cite>,' which he makes
use of in his lectures. The method he adopts is this: He reads a paragraph from this
little volume, and then comments upon it, and explains or developes it, often relating
interesting anecdotes suggested to him by the subject, or asking questions which the
foregoing lectures enable the scholars to reply to. The young men take notes, write
them out at home, and bring these papers to Mr. <span class="smcap">Coquerel</span> at the next lesson. The
lectures for young men take place twice a week, from October to May, and those for
young ladies at different hours during the same period. The scholars are admitted to
take the sacrament at Pentecost. M. <span class="smcap">Coquerel</span> is a most active and industrious man.
Beside several volumes of sermons, and innumerable papers for different religious journals,
he has published a very useful work, called '<cite>Biographie Sacrée</cite>,' in which every
name mentioned in the Bible is to be found. His manner is very animated; and as each
lecture lasts but an hour, it is impossible that the attention of the young hearers should
become weary.... '<span class="smcap">April</span> 19th. Went to the exhibition of paintings by living artists,
which is now open at the Louvre. The most beautiful picture there, is one by M. <span class="smcap">Cogniet</span>;
'<span class="smcap">Tintoretto</span> painting his dead Daughter.' The biographers of the great master
inform us, that he had a daughter who evinced great talent for painting, to whom he was
devotedly attached, but who died when young. M. <span class="smcap">Cogniet</span> has chosen the moment
when <span class="smcap">Tintoretto</span>, rising from his easel, on which rests the unfinished portrait, stands
gazing on his beloved daughter, who is lying on a bed in the fore-ground of the picture.
The father is almost <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de face</i>, but the lower part of his figure is concealed by the bed. A
crimson curtain falls behind him, and forms a rich but not gaudy back-ground to the picture
and, by throwing a slight reflection on the daughter's face, relieves the whole from that
disagreeable effect, which, with less judgment and good taste on the part of the artist, it
must have produced, without taking from it the solemnity which the subject required. This
is, on the whole, almost the only picture of the modern French school which pleases me
entirely; in which there is no exaggeration of expression or gesture, and which deserves
to be compared to those of the modern school of painting in Germany. I have no doubt
that the circumstance of an exhibition taking place every year is a great disadvantage to
young artists, who hurry to finish a picture for that occasion, in order that their names
may be mentioned in the journals, and that they may obtain a celebrity which lasts but
a few weeks. If the exhibition took place but once in five years, I am convinced we
should see more fine pictures at the Louvre. Among the portraits I remarked one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Major <span class="smcap">Poussin</span>, who resided for so many years in the United States. It is painted by
Mademoiselle <span class="smcap">Godefroid</span>, a pupil of <span class="smcap">Gerard</span>, and is a very good likeness. I was
struck by a portrait of M'lle de <span class="smcap">Fauveau</span>. This lady is of a noble family of Brittany,
and is well known for her devotion to the cause of the <span class="smcap">Duchess de Berri</span>, and
for the talent she has displayed in the art of sculpture. She is neither young nor handsome;
she is dressed in the costume of a peasant of Brittany, a sort of <i>blouse</i> or loose
frock, with her hair cut short in a strait line across her forehead, as we sometimes see it
in the portraits of the early French kings. There is a portrait of the <span class="smcap">Duke of Orleans</span>
at the Louvre. It was painted from memory by <span class="smcap">Scheffer</span>, a very clever artist. Some
of the fruit-pieces and portraits, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au pastel</i>, in colored chalks, are very beautiful. Indeed, the
French excel in this style of drawing. Among the paintings on porcelain we particularly
admired a Holy Family, copied from one of the old masters. It is a perfect bijou. The
day after our visit to the Louvre, Mrs. R&mdash;&mdash; took me to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">atelier</i> of Mr. <span class="smcap">Healy</span>, the
young American artist. His portrait of <span class="smcap">Washington</span>, copied from one by <span class="smcap">Stuart</span>,
gave great satisfaction to <span class="smcap">Louis Philippe</span>, and has been placed in one of the historical
galleries at Versailles. Mr. <span class="smcap">Healy</span> has now a beautiful picture of two of Colonel
<span class="smcap">Thorne</span>'s daughters, which he is retouching, at his room. The attitudes, particularly
that of the eldest of the young ladies, are very graceful, and the whole picture in very
good taste.'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Irish Sketch-Book.</span>&mdash;This capital work by 'Mr. M. A. <span class="smcap">Titmarsh</span>,' otherwise W. M.
<span class="smcap">Thackeray</span>, Esq., author of 'The Yellowplush Correspondence,' has just been published by Mr.
<span class="smcap">Winchester</span>, at the 'New World' office, in a very neat little pamphlet-volume, illustrated with
numerous engravings, from the pencil of the author. Our readers have had repeated evidences
of the high estimation in which we hold the writings of Mr. <span class="smcap">Thackeray</span>; and they may trust our
judgment in this, that they will find the volume before us to be second to no previous work of the
writer. It is, in fact, Ireland on canvass; its various cities and towns; its ludicrous modes of
travel, and more ludicrous travellers; its wretched poverty, its generous hospitality; its suffering,
and its indomitable good-humor. We were not until now aware that Mr. <span class="smcap">Titmarsh</span> was 'given
to song' as well as to romance and painting; but his 'Peg of Limavaddy,' a handsome kettle-scrubber,
who handed him his 'rummer' of ale, and laughed so joyously at an accident which
befel it, establishes the 'soft impeachment:'</p>

<p>We repeat, the 'Irish Sketch-Book' is a <em>capital</em> work, and cannot fail of very general popularity.
The author possesses a delicate appreciation of the beautiful, as well as a lively perception of the
ridiculous; a felicitous combination of faculties, since the union of fine taste and strong humor seldom
takes place in the same individual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>


<p>'<span class="smcap">Miseries of Human Life.</span>'&mdash;Some twenty-five years ago, a work in two or three
volumes, under this title, was republished in this city from an English edition. One of
these volumes lies before us; and if it be a fair representative of its companions, an
American publisher would not find it amiss to put forth a new issue of the book; for it
abounds in keen satire, playful wit, and pleasant humor. We have segregated from its
numerous divisions a few passages for the entertainment of our readers. A good deal
of what is termed 'criticism' upon works of art has lately been expended in this meridian
upon an undiscerning and unheeding public; yet we propose to add to the amount,
by copying the remarks of one Mr. <span class="smcap">Ned Testy</span> upon an exhibition of paintings and
statuary, similar, we may suppose, to the annual collections of our 'National Academy of
Design;' similar, certainly, in many of the points touched upon by the critic. After a
consideration of the Landscapes, 'with their meagre subjects, lying perspective, and
timid handling; their frittered lights, lumpy shadows, indigo skies, and saffron sands;
their forward back-grounds, and backward fore-grounds; with trees and meadows carefully
colored from an emerald, and water of such an hue and surface, that forgetting for a
moment the season represented, one looks narrowly after the <em>skaters</em>!'&mdash;after a discussion
of these, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</i>, we are favored with the subjoined 'hits' at a particular '<i>Family
Piece</i>:'</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A <span class="smcap">Young</span> man who 'wants encouragement,' had immortalized family affection, by representing
papa standing up at one end of the picture, ('his lips glued to each other, and his bullet eyes wide
open, though evidently seeing nothing,) and mamma at the other; the peace being kept between
them without the loss of an inch of space, by their endless progeny, whose heights and ages the
artist has most accurately registered, by stringing them strait out, closely linked together in a
descending series, like the reeds of Pan's pipe, which they farther resemble in the lank uprightness of
their figures, and the billious deadness of their complexions. The <em>next</em> of these Domestic Scenes
reproaches the idleness so remarkable in the foregoing, by the great variety of employment which
it exhibits, with the additional advantage of allowing more elbow-room to the fancy of the painter;
who in the first place has contrived to record, in the mother of the family, a truly exemplary
instance of notability, combined with maternal tenderness; for she is seen, at the same point of
time, engaged in nursing one child in her lap, rocking with her foot the cradle of another, hearing
the task of a third, and eyeing the frolics of a fourth; and all this without seeming at all distracted
from her needle, which she has just drawn out at the utmost stretch of her arm. The remaining
children are all liberally supplied with such occupations or amusements as, when followed at
proper times and places, must be allowed to become their sexes and ages, but which we are not
exactly prepared to see going on as here, all at once in the same parlor. The young ladies of this
extraordinary family can study their maps and globes, pore over their books, and even practice their
music-lessons, without appearing once to know that those boisterous and unruly little dogs, their
brothers, are cracking their whips, beating their drums, scampering about the room with their
wagons, etc.; the very baby in the cradle, instead of being frightened out of its wits, as might
reasonably be expected, only appearing to be lulled into a still sounder sleep, by the riotous
gambols going on.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Outraging nature is as common in art now as it was in the era of <span class="smcap">Ned Testy</span>. Here
you may see the picture of 'a lady in full length, gayly and archly tripping out in a hurricane
by herself, in thin fluttering muslin, without cap, hat, or bonnet, by the side of a
raging sea; where, if one may judge by the disposition of her limbs, and the archness of
her countenance, she is practising an <i>allemande</i> to the music of the thunder-claps which
seem bursting over her in all directions; yet without the slightest mark of concern in her
looks, or apparent apprehension of taking cold, after dancing under such discouraging
circumstances of dress and weather; there stares a young miss strait out of the picture,
with one hand grown to her side, and the other to the monstrous head of a Newfoundland
dog, <em>sitting</em> up exactly as high as she <em>stands</em>; and near by, in another frame, a parcel of
Months or Hours, in petticoats, are smiling and dancing jigs round an emblem, in the
shape of a good-looking woman in green, who is supposed to be Spring.' The critic
wonders 'why they haven't got to changing the Minutes, Seconds, and other inferior
parts of clock-work into little fluttering urchins.' But pause for a moment, reader, with
hushed respiration, while we set before you a specimen of <i>the Awful</i>! There is an
appropriate 'power of words' in the description of the 'grouping,' and doubtless the coloring
was 'in keeping;' as much so, perhaps, as in <span class="smcap">Dickens's</span> picture of the Wise Men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
of the East worshipping in a pink manger, or the Prodigal Son coming home in red rags
to a purple father and a sea-green calf, waiting to be roasted:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Here</span> is a piece equally stupendous in size and subject, bearing the semblance of having been
furiously thrown upon the canvass in the dark, from the disordered pallets of all the painters in the
Universe; a sort of maniac's vision, embodied into a rolling chaos, turbulently brewed up out of
the warring rudiments of smoke! blood! fire! night! whirlwind! earth! and water; a ruinous
huddle of every thing spiritual and material, real and conjectural, within and without the precincts
of possible Nature; and of every mingling shape, shade, color, quality, and consistence; the
whole congregated mass of discordances tumultuously wheeling, dashing, boiling, and thundering
together, in one giddy storm of&mdash;<span class="smcap">Nothing</span>!' The figures of this landscape are entirely in keeping
with it; 'ambiguous and reserved innuendos of beings, fluctuating somewhere among the
shadowy and unsettled nomenclatures of incantation; demon, wizzard, griffin, goblin, demi-gorgon,'
etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>After a few more examples of 'single criticism' in this kind, we are favored with a
'running commentary' upon the ostracised paintings which adorn the upper tiers, and
spaces over the doors: 'An upward glance of your eye introduces you to those poor
creatures in reduced sizes, who are sent to Coventry at the top of the room, and strung
along, by way of cornice, close under the ceiling; figures! but what language can adequately
report them!&mdash;their wooden features, their mortified complexions; their sneaking,
disconsolate, condemned looks; their quizzical head-dresses, and paste-board
draperies; their brick-dust curtains, increasing by contrast the chalkiness of their cheeks;
and that general and inveterate hardness of manner which instantly chases away all idea
of the elasticity of the flesh, and the flexibility of cloth or linen. Hard!&mdash;adamant is
<i>pap</i> to it!' The <em>Crayons</em> 'afforded striking examples of worse styles, by the help of
worse materials;' there were still-born efforts in black-lead pencil, from the hands of
academical tyros; wan historical sketches in water-color, by young ladies; imaginary
elevations of bridges that will never be built; naked fronts of huge white houses, that
sicken all eyes but those of the architect and the owner; and chuckle-headed busts in
plaster, of obscure, pudding-faced moderns; likenesses in India-ink, '<em>done in this manner</em>'
for almost nothing; etc., etc. An exhibition of this sort is certainly proved to be
one of the miseries of human life, 'by good witness.' But other miseries are enumerated;
and chief among them, the <em>humbugeousness</em> of quack advertisers, and the gullibility
of the public; and a medical sample is cited, which would do honor to any 'pill' or
'sarsaparilla' puff, of the present day:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'I <span class="smcap">should</span> be the most ungrateful of mankind, were I to delay for a moment to return my heart-felt
acknowledgments for the blessings I have derived from your inestimable pill. Before I was
so happy as to hear of its miraculous effects, life had long been a burden to me. I was an object
no less horrible than piteous to behold, being so entirely covered, or rather crusted, from head to
foot, with the most virulent blotches and humors, that I ought rather to have been called an <i>Ulcer</i>
than a man. I was at the same time so miserably emaciated, that my bones rattled audibly as I
moved, and my head itself seemed to hang to my shoulders by a thread. In short, to such a condition
was I reduced, that, on being carried to my own door upon a litter, on my return home after
a short absence in the vain search after ease, my wife, who chanced to meet me in the passage,
insisted that they had brought me to the wrong house, for that she had never seen me before! The
sound of my voice, however, but too cruelly undeceived her; and I was then conveyed to the bed
on which I continued to lie, without stirring hand or foot, for more than thirty years. During this
awful period matters were constantly and rapidly going on with me from bad to worse; scarcely
an hour passed but some new and still more deplorable disease was added to the complicated list
of maladies which were devouring me up piece-meal, in a manner; and it was a lucky day when
I could say that one or more of my bones had not dropped clean out of the socket! Sleep at one
time, I had none, for sixty-nine successive nights, unless I may call by that name a series of
swoons, brought on by my agonies, and the weakness consequent upon my reduced condition.
About this period, the flesh began to drop in large collops from my back and shoulders; and from
one hollow which formed exactly beneath my left pap, my heart was absolutely naked and visible,
by which my inquisitive surgeon was gratified, at my expense, with a living display of the whole
process of <i>systole</i> and <i>diastole</i>, as I think he called it. In this state of things, my case having been
pronounced absolutely hopeless by every physician in the land, my friends began to think it was
high time to call your invaluable remedy to my aid: and invaluable indeed it proved to me! No
sooner had I begun to use it, than the most surprising alteration came on: while I was swallowing
the first pill, I could plainly feel, to my inexpressible astonishment and delight, that a new and
perfect growth of healthy flesh was rapidly forming in every part of the skeleton to which I was
now wasted down; and before I had taken the third, I had reason to suspect, from certain strange
and indescribable sensations, as if of some hard substance pushing or shooting forth in different
places, that the numerous cavities left by the bones I had lost, were about to be filled up by a new
process of ossification; which, sure enough, was presently found to be vigorously and prosperously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
going on. My appetite, too, very shortly became so dangerously keen, that it was reckoned
prudent to refuse me a third fowl at my dinner. But not to trouble you with too many particulars,
(which to you, indeed, must be mere shadows of a thousand still more extraordinary cases,) I
will simply say, that by persevering in the course for one week more, I felt not only that every
symptom of disease had absolutely vanished as if by magic, but that I was suddenly able, (which
I had never been in the best days of my youth and strength,) to perform the most athletic feats in
leaping, wrestling, boxing, etc., without the slightest sensation of fatigue. To express the full
extent of my gratitude to you, my dear Sir, for this almost incredible restoration, is a task which I
must give up in despair; suffice it to say, that to Providence (under your pill) I shall ever acknowledge
myself indebted for the felicity I now enjoy.' 'P. S. Please send me without delay, by the
next coach, six dozen of the largest boxes of your Scorbutic Pills; though, indeed, I have not the
smallest apprehension of ever having occasion to use them again.'</p></blockquote>

<p>It would puzzle few of our readers, in town or country, to make a familiar application
of this satire upon the prevailing style of quack advertisements.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Gossip with Readers and Correspondents.</span>&mdash;In an admirable paper upon '<cite>The Poetry of
the Bible</cite>,' written for the <span class="smcap">Knickerbocker</span> some years since by Rev. <span class="smcap">William T. Brantley</span>,
President of the 'College of South Carolina,' there was an incidental allusion to the proofs of the
authenticity of the Sacred Word, as contained in the fulfilment of the 'prophecies concerning the
nations.' A dilapidated book-stall volume before us, with the title-page gone, and the author's
name nowhere to be met with, (facts in themselves noteworthy in this connection,) thus illustrates
the position of our valued correspondent: 'The primitive Christians regarded the Scriptures as
their chief and dearest treasure; and often laid down their lives rather than deliver the sacred
records to their enemies, who used every art of terror to seize and destroy them. Then, as now,
different parties and sects existed, who all appealed to the Scriptures for proof of their several
opinions; and these must have been so many checks upon each other, to the general exclusion of
mistake and fraud. But aside from this, look at their predictions, in the case of the 'chosen and
peculiar people.' The separation of the Israelites from the rest of mankind, not for their own
sakes but for the sake of all, and their preservation amidst their enemies, what a display is it of
the divine power! This great scheme of wisdom and goodness was carried on by its omnipotent
Author 'with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm.' 'He sent a man before his people, even
<span class="smcap">Joseph</span>, who was sold to be a bond-servant. He increased his people exceedingly, and made
them stronger than their enemies. He sent <span class="smcap">Moses</span> his servant, and <span class="smcap">Aaron</span>; and these showed
his tokens among them, and wonders in the land of Ham. He sent darkness, and it was dark,
and turned their waters into blood. Their land brought forth frogs, yea, even in their king's
chambers. He gave them hail-stones for rain, and flames of fire in their land. He spake the
word, and locusts came innumerable, and devoured the fruit of their ground. He smote all the
first-born in their land, even the chief of all their strength. He brought forth his people from
among them. He spread out a cloud to be a covering, and fire to give them light in the night season.
He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the deep as
through a wilderness. At their desire he brought quails, and filled them with the bread of heaven.
He opened the rock of stone, so that rivers ran in dry places. Yet within a while they forgot his
works, and tempted <span class="smcap">God</span> in the desert. Then the earth opened and swallowed up <span class="smcap">Dathan</span>, and
covered the congregation of <span class="smcap">Abiram</span>. The plague also was great among them. Then, being
chastised, they turned to their <span class="smcap">God</span>. He led them over Jordan: the waters divided to let them
pass. He discomfited their enemies. At His word the sun abode in the midst of Heaven; and
the moon stood still, and hasted not to go down for a whole day; so He gave the kingdoms of
Canaan to be an heritage unto his people; that all the nations of the world might know that the
hand of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is mighty, and that they might fear the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> continually.' Such was the result
of a scheme determined by divine goodness, planned by divine wisdom, foretold by divine knowledge,
accomplished by divine power. 'The things of the earth were changed into things of the
water, and the thing that did swim went upon the ground. The fire had power in the water contrary
to his own virtue, and the water forgat his own kind to quench. Thus the elements were
changed among themselves by a kind of harmony, as when one tune is changed upon an instrument
of music, and the melody still remaineth.' How graphic also is the description of the 'gift
of tongues,' conferred upon the Apostles! 'And they were all amazed, and marvelled, saying
one to another: 'Behold, are not all these which speak, Galileans? And how hear we every man
in our own tongue, wherein we were born? Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, the dwellers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
in Mesopotamia, and in Judea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia in
Egypt, and in the parts of Lybia about Cyrene. And strangers of Rome; Jews and proselytes,
Cretes and Arabians; we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of
<span class="smcap">God</span>!' * * * <span class="smcap">Most</span> likely many of our readers will remember this 'vexed question' in logic: 'It
either rains or it does not rain: but it does <em>not</em> rain; therefore it rains.' This used to puzzle us
hugely; as did also the mathematical problem, in simple equations, which ensues: '<em>A cat</em> has one
more tail than <em>no</em> cat; no cat has two tails; ergo, <em>a cat has three tails</em>!' The conclusion is irresistible.
Here is something, however, which is of deeper import: '<span class="smcap">Johnson</span> studied law with <span class="smcap">Dobson</span>,
under the agreement that he should pay <span class="smcap">Dobson</span>, when he (<span class="smcap">Johnson</span>) <em>gained his first cause</em>.
After a time <span class="smcap">Dobson</span> got tired of waiting for the conditions of the contract, and sued <span class="smcap">Johnson</span> for
his pay. He reasoned thus: 'If I sue him I shall get paid at any rate, because if I <em>gain</em> the cause,
I shall be paid by the decision of the court; if I <em>lose</em> it, I shall be paid by the conditions of the contract,
for then <span class="smcap">Johnson</span> will have gained his first cause; therefore I am safe.' <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>, on the
other hand, being prodigiously frightened, sought counsel, and was told to reason thus: '<span class="smcap">Dobson</span>
reasons well, but there must be a flaw in his argument; because <em>I</em> and not <em>he</em> will gain the victory.
If the suit goes in my favor, I shall gain it by the decision of the court; if it goes against
me, I shall gain it by the terms of the contract, not having yet won my first cause. Of course I
shall not have to pay him!' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive la Logique!</i> * * * This fine picture of the Arabian Desert is

<p>A <span class="smcap">correspondent</span>, well known to our readers, in a note to the Editor, remarks as follows,
upon the passage of our May 'Gossip' which touched upon <span class="smcap">Coleridge</span> and his conversations: 'I
am glad of your remarks on <span class="smcap">Coleridge</span> and <span class="smcap">Wordsworth</span>. I have been for years sick of the
interminable cant about those two men. Their admirers have too long exalted them above all that
is human. And would you know the reason? In discovering more depth, and pure humanity,
and high inspiration, in <em>their</em> school of the prophets than the <em>rest</em> of the world have seen, they think
the world will give them credit for deep penetration, high and refined sense, and a large share of
the same or a kindred humanity and inspiration. Witness a sixty pages' laudation of <span class="smcap">Wordsworth</span>,
opening a number of the 'New-York Review,' by a writer who doubtless thought his
own fame was thereby planted like an eternal light-house on the rock of his idol. Now I hope I
am Christian enough to admire greatly the genius of <span class="smcap">Coleridge</span>; and I am yet to find any thing
in English or elsewhere more movingly and musically beautiful than 'Genevieve,' or more wizard-like
and solemn than the 'Rime of the Antient Mariner.' I also plead not guilty to a contempt of
'Christabel' and 'Wallenstein.' Nor am I such a rebel to reason, or heretic in taste, as not to see
surpassing beauty in many of <span class="smcap">Wordsworth</span>'s minor poems, and lofty grandeur in his 'Ode to
Childhood,' and 'Stanzas on the Power of Sound,' and a high, philosophical, and musing mind in
his great 'Excursion.' I have read him twice in the last two years, and my admiration has not at
all diminished. But I choose to deny that he or <span class="smcap">Coleridge</span> <em>invented</em> poetry, or carried it farther,
or as far, as some others before and with them. I choose to deny that they have struck the great
chord of humanity, unstruck before, or have sympathized more deeply or more sweetly with the
joys and sorrows of the lowly million, than the great poets before them have done. I choose to
assert, what has been abundantly proven, that they were both great egotists, eaten up by self,
which the great poets have rarely been; and that <span class="smcap">Coleridge</span> in particular often knew not what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
he meant himself, but between opium and metaphysics, frequently tied the tail of one idea to the
head of another, and called the monstrous and unintelligible coalition a <em>theory</em>; a mixture of Platonism,
Spinozaism, and the d&mdash;&mdash;l knows what 'ism. And for believing this, the Coleridgeites
and Wordsworthites, who are the most intolerant of bigots, would call me an earthy blockhead,
and for expressing this, an ignorant, blaspheming fool. Why, I once had almost broken with a
friend, because I would not admit that <span class="smcap">Wordsworth</span> was superior to <span class="smcap">Byron</span>, and that <span class="smcap">Byron</span>
stole almost all his beauties from him! And the secret was, that the poor fellow thought he had
the Wordsworthian gift, and undeifying <span class="smcap">Wordsworth</span> was undeifying him!' * * * <span class="smcap">Are</span> not
the circumstances narrated in the following communication from a truly veracious correspondent,
'very remarkable,' to say the least? Can their truth be <em>doubted</em> for a moment, however,
by any intelligent reader? Yet 'it's curious, isn't it?' In a note to the Editor, our friend writes:
'I have an uncle 'down East,' a retired sea-captain, who having nothing else to do, frequently
writes me long gossipping letters. Sometimes they are very amusing: an extract from one of
them I now send you. The story appears almost incredible; but knowing my correspondent to
be a strictly conscientious man, who would scorn to draw the long-bow on any occasion, I have
no hesitation in believing every word of it, whether others are willing to credit it or not. I give it
to you in his own language, for there is a strait-forward simplicity about it, that should command
belief:'</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* * * '<span class="smcap">All</span> these things, dear S&mdash;&mdash;, happened in my younger days, of course. As I have still a white
page before me, I will detail to you one of my youthful adventures. I had one night been to a convivial
party, which did not break up until nearly morning, when, on arriving at my boarding-house, I found the
doors closed. Not wishing to disturb the inmates at that unseasonable hour, I proceeded in search of temporary
lodgings, not doubting but that I should get accommodated at some one of the numerous hotels. In this
however I was disappointed; every place was shut as tight as an oyster. It happened to be a wet, drizzly
night; and after wandering about the streets for some time, and getting pretty well soaked, I began to feel
rather disagreeable. What added not a little to my discomfort, was the fact that within a few nights there
had been committed several daring highway robberies, in the very heart of the city, in one of which the victim
was murdered; and as a natural consequence, no watchman dared to venture out from his hiding-place;
thus making my situation doubly lonesome. In this dilemma, finding all legitimate places closed against me,
I began to consider the expediency of seeking shelter at least, if not sleep, in any place that might seem to
offer it. While in this mood, I found myself abreast of the &mdash;&mdash; church; and leaning against the lightning-rod
a moment, the query occurred to me: 'Why not 'shin up' this rod into the belfry? I have slept in worse
places than that, no doubt, and can do so again.' Now I had been a great climber in my boyish days; and
feats which to others seemed difficult, if not absolutely impossible, were to me often matters of mere pastime.
I therefore hesitated but a moment in such an emergency, but slipping off my boots and swinging them
round my neck, I commenced the ascent; and in less than five minutes I had mounted a hundred feet or
more, and got safely into the belfry. My accommodations here were much better than I could have anticipated.
Some carpenters had been to work a few days previously, repairing the railings on the outside of the
tower, and had left a quantity of shavings, which lay scattered on the floor. Placing these together in a heap,
I threw my weary limbs down upon them, and was soon in a deep slumber, but not a quiet one. My horizontal
position enabled the fumes of wine to reach my head, which before they had been unable to do, in
consequence of my extreme height, for you know I am six feet three, and I soon began to have all sorts of
fantastic dreams. Strange wild shapes flitted around me, and loud unearthly sounds filled my ears. But
prominent over all, was an incessant ding-dong of apparently distant bells, which reached me in every variety
of volume and tone; now low and sweet, and anon loud, startling, and many-toned, as if the thousand steeples
of Moscow were again pouring forth lamentations over the ruins of their beautiful city. Suddenly, a
single stroke, that sent its vibrations through every limb, startled me from sleep; and lifting my head slightly,
I at the instant received a blow upon the back of it that sent me quivering against the frame of the belfry. I
lay stunned for some moments; and on recovering my consciousness, the bell of the steeple was just closing,
with a strange jangle, the peal for seven o'clock in the morning!</p>

<p>'I now comprehended the whole. The edge of the bell, on its return revolution, had come in contact with
my head at the instant I had lifted it, on being roused by the first stroke. I placed my hand upon the back of
my scull, and the proof of that fact lay there too prominent to be denied. A bump had been raised as big as
a hen's egg. I paid but little attention to it, however, as the pain was but slight, and I was moreover exceedingly
anxious about the mode of extrication from my present unenviable predicament. Sliding down the
lightning-rod of a meeting-house, in broad day-light, was not quite so pleasant a performance as 'shinning up'
one at midnight. While considering this matter, in a sort of a 'quandary way,' as brother <span class="smcap">Jonas</span> used to say,
the scuttle-door slowly opened, and the sexton of the church made his appearance. He did not observe me,
but went immediately to the bell, which he began to walk round, and to inspect very minutely. At last he
stopped: 'It's just as I expected,' said he to himself: 'the bell's cracked! Now what upon airth could ha'
done it? I am sure I felt it hit something hard.' Here I mechanically placed my hand to the back of my
head, and coughed slightly. The man turned, and observing me, started back with affright. I immediately
stepped forward, and told him my story in a few words, taking care to make it as lucid as possible by the aid of
a little silver, and saying nothing, of course, about the bump on my head. The man appeared satisfied, and
told me I could go down with him. Before starting, however, I bestowed a hasty glance upon the bell, and
perceived that it was indeed cracked, longitudinally, from the flange to the crown, and that a lock of my hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
was firmly inclosed in the crevice, just on the outer edge. This of course was enough to remove from my
mind all doubt, had I had any, as to the cause of the mischief; but I said nothing, and followed the sexton down
the scuttle. In a few moments I was once more in the streets, with my hat under my arm, for I found it impossible
to place it any where near its true position on my head, in consequence of the new phrenological development
already mentioned. But now, dear S&mdash;&mdash;, comes the most wonderful part of my narrative. This little
incident happened twenty years ago; and to my certain knowledge, since that date, the bell in that steeple has
been replaced four times; and yet to this very day, whenever I pass within hearing of its tones, my ears begin
to ring, my head violently to oscillate, and straitway I am seized with a stupor and dizziness that continue
until I can get beyond the reach of its sound. You will recollect you once asked me why old Major
N&mdash;&mdash; called me sometimes 'Captain Hardhead,' and sometimes 'Captain Waghead?' You have now the
answer.'</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> water stood in our eyes, reader, (and it will stand in yours if you have a heart to feel,) as
we perused the subjoined eloquent passage of a letter from a friend to whom our readers have
often been indebted for amusement, entertainment, and instruction. What a startling picture it
presents of the first approaches of that 'hectic,' 'phthisic,' 'consumption,' or whatever be the
favorite title of that most wily and fatal foe, who in one hand presents the insidious olive-branch,
and in the other conceals his inevitable sword, cutting down youth in its blossom and manhood in
its fruit! 'For very many years, from twelve to two have been my hours of retiring, and my
exercise has been nothing, or nearly so, during the day. One result has been, that I have read
one half of the Greek and Roman classics, and feasted largely in modern literature. A parallel
result has been, that owing to corporeal sluggishness and nervousness, the curse of the sedentary,
I have no doubt reaped less pleasure and profit than I might have done from half that assiduity
coupled with a due regard to the wants of the body. The final result is, that an iron constitution
is now largely disorganized; and from the constant presence of a dull, deep, stationary pain in
my left side beneath the ribs, and fixed I fear upon the lungs, I begin to indulge in sad and deep
forebodings. Often, when wakened by its painful urgency, I lie in the silence of the night, listening
to my heart's deep beatings, and recall my early and yet unfulfilled dreams&mdash;dreams oh! how
glorious!&mdash;and array before my unsated eyes this world, with all its lovely learning, and sweet
poetry, and burning passion; and reflect how unfit I am to die, and try the conditions of a new
existence, before I have fulfilled the duties and perused the mysteries of this, and then think of
the wormy bed, and anticipate the hour when I shall lie there, closing my eyes to coloring and my
ears to sound; the impatient longing I have sometimes felt for death is repaid by an indefinable
horror; and between the tenderness of natural regret and the shudderings of unconquerable
awe, passion masters pride, and both sink to meekness and humility in a flood of gushing
tears!' * * * '<i>The Warning</i>,' in its <em>spirit</em> at least, is borrowed. We are sorry to intimate this, but
it is a <em>fact</em>, friend 'P.' You could not say that you have not read the poem which commences as
follows, (if we rightly remember,) 'could you, now?' Guess not:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<span class="smcap">All</span> in the wild March morning I heard the angels call;<br /></span>

<p>We gave on one occasion an extract from one of the 'Short Patent Sermons' of '<span class="smcap">Dow</span>, Jr.,'
illustrating the endless extent of <em>for ever</em>. The same sublimity of conception is apparent in the subjoined
glance at the magnitude of the planets, and the unsocial 'distance' they keep up between
one another: 'If a person were sufficiently long-legged to step from star to star, and were to go at
a decent dog-trot, he might as soon think of travelling from everlasting to everlasting and back
again in a day, as to undertake to find an end to the planets which roll round their respective suns,
as far beyond this insignificant solar system of ours as the farthest flight of imagination is beyond
the jump of a ham-stringed grasshopper!' By the by, 'speaking of <span class="smcap">Dow</span>,' here is a capital anecdote
of the veritable <span class="smcap">Lorenzo</span>, which is worthy of record. 'It appears' that <span class="smcap">Dow</span>, in one of his
odd, quaint sermons, declared that he 'had known sinners so very wicked that they actually
bu'st!' This statement threw an old, ignorant, and fat impenitent present into a state of alarm
and perspiration; and home he waddled, in mortal terror. At night, in the horror of his anticipated
explosion, he rolled about until he could no longer bear it. He fancied he was already swelling.
He rose and attempted to dress himself, in order to go out 'al fresco.' Who can paint his
consternation, when he found he could but just strain the garments over his limbs, and even then
they would not meet! He was suffering a rapid sin-dropsy; his iniquities were coming to light!
He screamed in the agony of his fear; and a lamp being brought in, he found that in his haste he
had put on his brother's clothes. 'The impression, however, says our informant, a clergyman of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the Church of England, 'was a salutary one, for he became a pious man.' * * * <span class="smcap">The 'Knickerbocker'-Steamer</span>,
that floating palace of the Hudson, must not pass unnoticed by 'the editor
hereof.' To <em>describe</em> her, however, and her superb 'belongings,' her Dutch paintings and quaint
adornments, is quite another thing. We have no space for an <em>essay</em> in this department of <span class="smcap">Maga</span>.
It shall suffice to say, therefore, that this truly magnificent vessel is in all respects worthy the honored
<em>name</em> she bears. Could we say more? Appropos of this: It was not until the first volume
of the <span class="smcap">Knickerbocker</span> appeared, (this is our <span class="smcap">TWENTY-SECOND</span>, reader; and, <em>non</em>-reader, an
excellent opportunity for you to commence <em>your</em> subscription,) that one met our noble potronymic
'about town.' How is it <em>now</em>? Let the <span class="smcap">Knickerbocker</span> steamers, bathing-houses, omnibii,
restaurants, clubs&mdash;aquatic, literary, social, military, scientific, and artistic&mdash;and eke the Temperance-halls
and root-beer <em>perambulatories</em>, make answer! Their reply is triumphant; and yet
'our' children play with the neighbor's children, just the same as if these were not 'parlous facts!'
This, however, is one of the tendencies of that republican form of government under which it is
our happiness to reside! * * * <span class="smcap">Are</span> not these lines of <span class="smcap">Motherwell</span> very beautiful? Such
thoughts have we had a thousand times; and we desire to thank the writer for expressing them
for us so well:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small</span> game, Mein Herr, of Albany&mdash;small game! A 'two-penny dip' would be wasted on
it. Our correspondent's critique reminds us of the tailor in Laputa, who being employed in
making a suit for the facetious <span class="smcap">Gulliver</span>, disdained the vulgar measures of his profession, and
took that gentleman's altitude by the help of a quadrant! We can pounce upon <em>fair</em> game, but
we cannot 'like French falcons, fly at any thing we see.' Beside, if the satire was 'caviare to
the <span class="smcap">General</span>' of the '<i>New-Mirror</i>,' how should it find a place in <em>these</em> pages? Our friend 'the
Brigadier' is a fastidious and a prudent person. Did he not alter a quotation from <span class="smcap">Byron</span>, in one
of our friend <span class="smcap">Graham</span>'s 'Sketches by a Briefless Lawyer,' wherein '<em>waistcoat</em>-pocket' was substituted
for that startling indelicacy, '<em>breeches</em>-pocket?' Verily, he did! * * * <span class="smcap">The</span> following
reflections upon the death of friends, and the memories of the departed, which we transcribe from
a private letter to the Editor, are too beautiful and true to be confined to one or two readers only:
'I have read the exhortations of <span class="smcap">Plutarch</span>, and <span class="smcap">Seneca</span>, and <span class="smcap">Jeremy Taylor</span>, and others, all
hinging upon the idea that pain and bereavement are natural, necessary, inevitable, in this world
of successive bloom and desolation. But pain is to me none the less painful because natural, nor
separation less overwhelming for its necessity; nor yet is the blasting of cherished hopes less
withering to my heart because the same blight has fallen on the verdure of other hearts, and kindred
tears are falling from a world of mourners in a wide companionship of grief. 'The head
may <em>reason</em>, but the heart will <em>feel</em>.' Time, however, is a great and effectual healer. Though a
tree be lopped to the very root, the maimed giant will send up a new creation of vegetable
strength. So the human soul, like some evergreen creeper, if you cut off or tear away its
branches of affection with the object round which they entwined themselves, will send forth other
tendrils, and wind its clinging arms around some other idol, embalming it with fragrance and
clothing it in verdure. The sweet lines of <span class="smcap">Wordsworth</span> are most practical and true, as well as
poetical:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'There is a comfort in the strength of love:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'T will make a thing endurable, which else<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would overset tire brain, or break the heart.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>'And while there is one, and more than one, whose redemption from their iron sleep I would
gladly purchase by a subtraction from the remnant of my own dismembered life, and principally
that visible gushing tears, and the test of so great a sacrifice, might be some atonement for causeless
misconceptions, and some proof of warm love beneath the outward shows of an inflexible
hardness; yet I know that Time in his weary revolutions will soon bring us all together in a world
of infinite knowledge, and liberal forgiveness, and uncircumscribed affection; a world where we
shall 'see face to face,' and feel heart to heart; 'where no grief makes the heart heavy and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
eye-lids red.' * * * <span class="smcap">Standing</span> with a friend the other day by the river-side, to take in the noble
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d'&oelig;il</i> of the new steamer <span class="smcap">Knickerbocker</span>, we overheard a little anecdote connected with
water-craft, which made our companion merry all the way home; which we shall here transcribe;
'<em>and</em> which it is hoped may please.' 'It seems there was' (nay, we know not <em>seems</em>, there <em>was</em>)
a verdant youth from the interior of Connecticut, for the first time on board a steam-boat. His
curiosity was unbounded. He examined here, and he scrutinized there; he wormed from the
engineer a compulsory lecture on the steam-engine and mechanics in general, and from the fireman
an essay on the power of white heat, and the 'average consumption of pine cord-'ood.' At
length his inquiring mind was checked in its investigations, and 'the pursuit of knowledge under
difficulties' made at once apparent. He had mounted to the wheel-house, and was asking the
pilot: 'What you doin' <em>that</em> for, Mister?&mdash;what <em>good</em> does't do?' when he was observed by the
captain, who said, in a gruff voice: 'Go away from there! Don't you see the sign, 'No talkin'
to the man at the hellum? Go 'way!' 'Oh! certing&mdash;yäes; I only wanted to know &mdash;&mdash;' 'Well
you <em>do</em> know now that you can't talk to him; so go 'way!' With unwilling willingness, the verdant
youth came down; and, as it was soon dark, he presently went below; but four or five times
before he 'turned in,' he was on deck, and near the wheel-house, eyeing it with a thoughtful curiosity;
but with the captain's public rebuff still in his ears, venturing to ask no questions. In the
first gray of the dawn, he was up, and on deck; and after some hesitation, perceiving nobody
near but the pilot, who was turning the wheel, as when he had last seen him, he preferred his
'suppressed question' in the oblique style peculiar to his region: 'Wal, goin' it <em>yit</em> ha?&mdash;been at
it all night?&mdash;<em>screëwin on her up?</em>&mdash;eh?' What vague conjectures must have bothered the poor
querist's brain, during the night, may be partly inferred from the absurd but 'settled conviction' to
which he had at length arrived! * * * <span class="smcap">What</span> a mingling of the dead Past with the busy, bustling
Present pervades the mind of the thoughtful observer, as he looks down from the rising tower of
the New Trinity Church upon tens of thousands of the dead whose bones crowd the grave-yard
below; bones, and dust and ashes, over which are thrown in wild confusion huge blocks from
the quarry, and piles of uprooted grave-stones, and slabs and urns of marble! As you have
marked an elaborately-carved stone sink slowly from its ponderous 'drop' to its place in an edifice
which is to stand for ages, did you never scan closely its grained streaks, its delicate chissellings,
with the thought that when you were senseless clay, that <em>very stone</em> might arrest the eye of
another, gazing upon it with sensations like your own? So at least have we thought, concerning
those who have gone before us, as we have looked at the ornamental marbles of our older public
buildings, erected in another age. But from the countless Dead, who slumber below, how
solemnly comes up toward this rising tower the voice of warning and monition! Each 'storied
urn' takes the form of the Departed whom it commemorates, and seems to say:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<span class="smcap">Time</span> was I stood, as thou dost now,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And viewed the Dead as thou dost me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere long thou'lt lie as low as I,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And others stand to look on thee!'<br /></span>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wallace</span>, the great musical <i>Wonder</i>, is not now in town, but, reader, should he return
among us, be sure to neglect no opportunity to hear him. In his hands, the piano seems like an
instrument hitherto unknown. It has the chant of woodland birds, the silver sound of dropping
waters, and 'all voices of nature and of art.' We have heard no resemblance to Mr. <span class="smcap">Wallace</span>,
as a pianist. But it is his violin which <em>speaks</em> to us; and on this instrument no approach to Mr.
<span class="smcap">Wallace</span> has been met with in this country. How exquisite the notes, pathetic, joyful, or in
'linked sweetness long drawn out' which he conjures from that most facile of all instruments!
We would travel ten miles to hear him play, in his style, that ravishing melody, 'The Last Rose
of Summer.' We shall have occasion, we hope, again to advert to the performances of Mr. <span class="smcap">Wallace</span>.
He is yet a young man, and possesses the characteristic modesty of true genius; and has
hardly yet learned that 'the world meets nobody half way;' in <em>his</em> case, however, not a necessary
lesson. * * * <span class="smcap">If</span> any of our town readers are fond, by way of literary variety and contrast, of

the Astor House. We have been indebted to the courtesy of these gentlemen for sundry communings
with authors who have been in their graves for five or six centuries. Every <em>ancient book</em>

fossil Megatherion, Icthyosaurus, were to begin to <em>speak</em> from amid its rock-swathings, never so
indistinctly! Yet the most extinct fossils of Men can do, and does, this miracle&mdash;thanks to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
letters of the alphabet!' * * * <span class="smcap">The</span> friend who sends us, for 'a fragment of Gossip,' the anecdote
of the verdant field-preacher who spoke of Saint <span class="smcap">Paul</span>'s having 'sat at the foot of <i>Gammel-Hill</i>,'
is informed that it has already appeared in the <span class="smcap">Knickerbocker</span>. The following specimen of kindred
ignorance, however, is quite new to us, and worthy of repetition. It is a precious bit of
ignorant bathos, which occurred in a discourse upon the sufferings of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>: 'The blessed
<span class="smcap">Saviour</span>, my hearers, was dreadfully persecuted. Once, when going to Jerusalem, the Jews put
him on a wild young jack-ass, and scattered branches in the road, and put clothes onto 'em, in
order for to scare the little colt, and make him break the blessed Redeemer's neck!' The speaker
actually preached this <em>three times</em>, till one of his congregation corrected him!' * * * <span class="smcap">The</span> articles
in the Edinburgh Review, and other eminent European periodicals, against the custom of the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">duello</i>, would seem to be but the echoes of a prevalent public opinion. We perceive by late
English journals that an <cite>Anti-Duelling Association</cite> has recently been formed in London. 'It consists
of three hundred and twenty-six members, including twenty-one noblemen, thirteen sons of
noblemen, sixteen members of Parliament, fifteen baronets, thirty admirals and generals, forty-four
captains R. N., twenty-three colonels and lieutenant-colonels, seventeen majors, twenty-six
captains in the army, twenty lieutenants R. N., and twenty-four barristers. They denounce duelling
as 'sinful, irrational, and contrary to the laws of <span class="smcap">God</span> and man;' and pledge themselves to
'discountenance the practice, both by example and influence.' The association includes, says
a London journal, many members who have been successful heretofore in 'killing their
man.' * * * <span class="smcap">One</span> of the most delightful as well as most accessible places of summer resort in the
vicinity of New-York, is the '<span class="smcap">Hamilton House</span>,' a spacious and elegant <em>palace</em> of an edifice, situated
on the south-westernmost extremity of Long-Island, on the picturesque bluff at the ocean-entrance
to the Narrows, commanding a wide view of the sea, the lower bay, Staten-Island, and
the rich and cultivated fields of Long-Island; a combination of scenery unsurpassed on the Atlantic
sea-board. Here, amidst healthful and invigorating sea-airs, and charming views; with spacious
and well-ventilated apartments, public and private; 'tables richly spread;' wines of the
best, and the means of recreation, natural and artificial, in abundance; what could one want
more?&mdash;save perhaps the ready attention and courtesy of the proprietor, Mr. <span class="smcap">J. R. Curtis</span>, and
these are 'matters of course.' Go to the 'Hamilton House,' ye invalids and pining wights 'in
populous city pent.' * * * <span class="smcap">We</span> find the annexed charming translation in the hand-writing of Mr.
<span class="smcap">Longfellow</span>, among the papers of the late lamented <span class="smcap">Willis Gaylord Clark</span>:</p>

<p class="center">SUMMER TIME IN GERMANY.<br />

FROM JEAN PAUL.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> summer alone might elevate us! Heaven! what a season! In sooth, I often know not
whether to stay in the city, or go forth into the fields, so alike is it every where, and beautiful. If
we go outside the city gate, the very beggars gladden our hearts, for they are no longer a-cold;
and the post-boys can pass the whole night merrily on horse-back; and the shepherds lie asleep
in the open air. We want no gloomy house. We make a chamber of every bush; and so have
my good industrious bees before us, and the most gorgeous butterflies. In gardens on the hills sit
school-boys, and in the open air look out words in the dictionary. On account of the game-laws
there is no shooting now; and every living thing in bush and furrow and on the green branches,
can enjoy itself right heartily and safely.</p>

<p>In all directions come travellers along the roads. They have their carriages, for the most part,
thrown back. The horses have branches stuck in their saddles, and the drivers roses in their
mouths. The shadows of the clouds go trailing along, and the birds fly between them up and
down. Even when it rains do we love to stand out of doors, and inhale the quickening influence;
and the wet does the herdsman harm no more!</p>

<p>And is it night, so sit we only in a cooler shadow, from which we plainly discern the day-light
on the northern horizon, and on the sweet, warm stars of heaven. Whithersoever I look, there
do I find my beloved blue; on the flax in blossom, on the corn-flowers, and the godlike, endless
heaven, into which I would fain plunge as into a river!</p>

<p>And now if we turn homeward again, we find only fresh delight. The whole street is one
great nursery; for in the evening after supper, the little ones, though they have but few clothes
upon them, are again let out into the open air, and not driven to bed as in winter. We sup by
day-light, and hardly know where the candle-sticks are. In the bed-chambers the windows are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
open day and night, and likewise most of the doors, without danger. The oldest women stand
by the window without a chill, and sew. Flowers lie about every where; by the ink-stand, on
the lawyer's papers, on the judge's desk, and the tradesman's counter. The children make a
great noise, and one hears the rolling of nine-pin alleys. Half the night through, one walks up
and down the street, and talks loud, and sees the stars shoot in the high heaven. The foreign
musicians, who wend their way homeward toward midnight, go fiddling along the street, and the
whole neighborhood runs to the window. The extra posts arrive late, and the horses neigh. One
sits in the noise by the window, and drops asleep, and the post-horns awake him; and the whole
starry heaven hath spread itself open. Oh, <span class="smcap">God</span>! what a joyous life, on this little earth!</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">What</span> is more ridiculous to a dandy than a philosopher, or to a philosopher than a dandy?'
We thought of this query, while reading a description, in a communication before us, of a knot of
fourth-rate dandies, the 'apes of apes,' <em>which</em> the writer encountered in the bar-room of an inn, in
one of the fourth-rate towns of Maryland. Doubtless these artificial 'humans' looked upon our
friend as quite to be pitied that he was not '<em>one of us</em>:' 'In their ultra dress, affected manners,
drawling tones, and whey-faces, you might read the foolish inanity of an existence parallel in
every respect to that of <span class="smcap">Beau Brummel</span>, except that his was original absurdity, and theirs was
folly on loan. It was Parisianism adulterated in London, qualified in Broadway, weakened in
Chestnut-street, reduced in Baltimore, and at last in these provincial decoctions diluted to the lowest
possible degree of insipidity, with scarce a perceptible tincture of the original liquid. These
had no souls by nature; and the only idea they could inspire was one of humiliation, that apes
were permitted to wear the likeness of <span class="smcap">God</span>'s image.' * * * <span class="smcap">We</span> annex below a few random
comments from an old and favorite contributor, (a 'scholar ripe and good,' who holds a felicitous
pen,) upon three or four papers in our May number: '<span class="smcap">John Quod</span> is beyond all praise. I read
the May chapters throughout with unqualified delight. The passage describing the old lawyer's
affixing his own name, in his confusion, to the blind man's will, aroused me to unseemly, uproarious
laughter; and the <em>painting</em> of Kornicker's manner, particularly his laugh, is scarcely inferior
to <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>'s account of Leatherstocking's noiseless, inward laugh, the impression of which could
not fade from my fancy in a thousand years. I'll wager my head that the May number of no
Magazine in the world contains a sketch of more power and humor. As for the '<cite>Lay of Ancient
Rome</cite>,' I cannot praise it too highly. The imitations of ancient manners, and the <em>keeping</em> with
ancient ideas, is excellent, <em>excellent</em> indeed; far better than the efforts of <span class="smcap">Bulwer</span>, in his 'Last
Days of Pompeii,' or than any other late imitations which I just now remember to have seen.
Fresh from the perusal of <span class="smcap">Anthon</span>'s 'Horace,' (<span class="smcap">Anthon</span>'s classics are entirely unequalled,) and with
<span class="smcap">Livy</span> in my reach, the verisimilitude strikes me as almost perfect. You cannot fail either, to observe
that, as in the '<cite>Three Passages in the History of a Poet</cite>,' there is a great deal of sweet poetry scattered
about among the jewels of delicate criticism and mirthful wit. I believe my love for the old
Greeks and Romans is a little unreasonable; but it is my first love. I often woo other mistresses,
but I always return to my 'prima donna.' Twelve or fourteen years ago I ingorged all of <span class="smcap">Smollet</span>,
<span class="smcap">Fielding</span>, <span class="smcap">Richardson</span>, <span class="smcap">Scott</span>, and <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>, at one intemperate meal, and then lay some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
months inert and drowsy, like a huge boa-constrictor after swallowing a bullock. Then again for
several years I dieted on Greek and Roman and early English literature. Once more I devoured
all then published of <span class="smcap">Edgeworth</span>, <span class="smcap">Bulwer</span>, <span class="smcap">James</span>, <span class="smcap">Marryat</span>, and I know not how many others,
rolled up in one monstrous mass. I wonder it had n't killed me; but the process of digestion
brought me again to a state of healthful depletion, and my natural appetite revived. So, although
I am delighted with genius, or talent, or wit, or mere taste, no matter when or where I encounter
it, yet I cannot forget my youthful worship, or forego my early gods. The death-scene in '<cite>The
Young Englishman</cite>,' I do declare, went to my very heart. I have had since continually before my
eyes the poor youth, flying from his destroyer, whose unerring dart was already in his bosom.
What a mournful comment on that most affecting passage of Virgil, where the wounded deer flies
from the pursuer, (who is in truth her companion,) with the arrow for ever in her side&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hæret lateri
lethalis arundo</i>&mdash;flies through the summer forests, all heedless of their greenness, and lies down
by some blue streamlet, helpless and hopeless to die! Seeing the other day a number of '<span class="smcap">Graham</span>'s
Magazine,' I read in it an article by <span class="smcap">E. A. Poe</span>, who comes down on your old correspondent
'<span class="smcap">Flaccus</span>' like a mountain of lead! It is clear that '<span class="smcap">Flaccus</span>' has in many places exposed himself
to the charge of unmelodious rhymes, incongruous figures, and occasionally faulty taste. But
there is a difference between a <span class="smcap">Pope</span> that sometimes nods, and a <span class="smcap">Cibber</span> that <em>never wakes</em>! I am
not easily moved, in the matter of poetry; I <em>think</em>, at least, that it must have merit to please me;
and I well remember that <span class="smcap">Flaccus</span>'s metrical love-tale in your pages seemed to me very sweet
and original, and strongly redolent of the early English odor. His 'Epistle from my Arm-chair'
was in good hexameters, and his 'Address to the President of the New-England Temperance
Society' had a <span class="smcap">Tom Moore</span>-ish spice of elegant wit about it, and might have been written by Mr.
<span class="smcap">Poe</span> in about a century of leap-years.' * * * <span class="smcap">The</span> venerable <span class="smcap">Noah Webster</span>, full of years and
full of honors, has gone down to his grave, 'like a shock of corn fully ripe in its season.' Our
very earliest associations, like those of millions of others, are associated with his name. That
blue-covered spelling-book of his, with its progressive lessons of learning and morality; its pleasant
fables and pretty pictures; its large type and dingy paper&mdash;the very <em>smell</em> of that spelling-book&mdash;all
are as vivid in our mind as when we first took it to bed with us, in an ecstacy of
enjoyment, some score and a half of years agone. And then his great philological work, which
is now so well known in both hemispheres, what a monument it is of careful research, discriminating
judgment, laborious industry! It will die only with the 'land's language.' Mr. <span class="smcap">Webster</span>
has been a frequent and always a welcome contributor to these pages; and we have even now
in our possession late communications from his pen, of which our readers will know more hereafter.
<span class="smcap">Noah Webster</span> was an honor to his country. He was a scholar; a 'gentleman of the
old school,' who lived a life void of offence toward <span class="smcap">God</span> and toward man; and he died in the full
assurance of a blessed immortality. May he rest in peace! * * * '<i>Poetry run Mad</i>' is inadmissible,
on two accounts. In the first place, it strikes us we have met <em>parts</em> of it at least before; and
in the second, the style has 'outlived our liking.' Nobody but <span class="smcap">Hood</span> manages well this ragged
species of verse; a very clever specimen of which is contained in his '<i>Custom-House Breeze</i>,' the
story of a lady-smuggler who would not go ashore at Dover, because there was 'a <em>searching</em> wind'
blowing, which might expose the lace-swathings of her person:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">'<span class="smcap">In</span> spite of rope and barrow, knot, and tuck,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of plank and ladder, there she stuck!<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'But, Ma'am,' the steward interfered,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">'The wessel must be cleared.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You mus'n't stay aboard, Ma'am, no one don't!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It's quite ag'in the orders so to do,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And all the passengers is gone but you.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Says she, 'I cannot go ashore and won't!'<br /></span>
<span class="i12">'You ought to!'<br /></span>
<span class="i14">'But I can't!'<br /></span>
<span class="i12">'You must!'<br /></span>
<span class="i14">'I sha'n't!''<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have given no notice of <span class="smcap">Carlyle</span>'s '<cite>Past and Present</cite>,' for the reason, let us inform the publishers,
that we received no copy of the work. We have perused the book, however; and are
compelled to say that in its style it exhibits no improvement upon the previous writings of its distinguished
author. It is even less clear, to our comprehension, (or perhaps from the <em>lack</em> of it,) than
any of his former productions. We are sorry to see, moreover, that he is obliged to <em>repeat himself</em>
so frequently. Yet is there much matter for deep thought in his pages, and sometimes a whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
sermon in a single sentence. His heart bleeds for his suffering fellow-men in England, Ireland,
and Scotland; 'twelve hundred thousand workers, their cunning right hand lamed, lying idle in
their sorrowful bosoms; asking only for work, and such return for it in food, clothes, and fuel, as
shall enable them to live, that they may still work on;' yet we do not see that Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlyle</span> points
out any means by which these many 'workers' may obtain redress of the 'crowned, coronetted,
shovel-hatted, quack-heads' whose rule he stigmatizes so severely. Here is a fine passage illustrating
the fact that he only is successful who is 'fortunate for good:' 'Success! If the thing is
<em>unjust</em>, thou hast not succeeded, no, not though bonfires blazed from north to south, and bells
rang, and editors wrote leading articles, and the just thing lay trampled out of sight, to all mortal
eyes an abolished and annihilated thing. Success! In a few years thou wilt be dead and dark;
all cold, eyeless, deaf; no blaze of bonfires, ding-dong of bells, or leading articles, visible or
audible to thee again for ever! What kind of success is that?' It is not possible for Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlyle</span>
to write a stupid or an unreadable volume; and it can only be affirmed, in dispraise of the
present work, that it is less forceful and attractive than one or two of its immediate predecessors.
* * * <span class="smcap">You</span> are wrong, Sir 'P. F.,' <em>altogether</em> wrong. The 'competence' of the tiller of the
soil, the 'abundance' of the successful mechanic, and the 'sufficiency' of the tradesman, we conceive
to be better calculated to promote happiness than 'great wealth,' even when unencumbered.
We are not insensible to the value of money. Our remark was pointed as to the <em>wants</em> that wealth
brings; but the <em>cares</em> of it are not less exacting. 'Don't you <em>know</em> me?' said a western millionaire,
soon after 'the crisis,' to a friend of ours, with whom he had formerly been intimately
acquainted; 'don't you <em>remember</em> me? My name is &mdash;&mdash;.' 'Good heavens! it can't be possible!'
exclaimed our friend; 'why, what has wrought such a change in your appearance? Where's
your flourishing head of hair? where's your flesh gone? what's put that bend in your back?'
'The times! the times!' replied the 'poor rich man;' as for my back, I broke that last year, <em>lifting
notes</em>; some of them were very heavy.' A grievous and unnecessary burden no doubt they
were; and how much better was the rich man's 'wealth,' with its carking cares, than the 'abundance'
of the contented mechanic?' * * * A <span class="smcap">MOST</span> forcible warning to 'nations that know not
<span class="smcap">God</span>' is contained in the following passage from a recent discourse by Rev. <span class="smcap">Geo. B. Cheever</span>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">This</span> world has been the theatre of a mighty experiment&mdash;whether nations could be prosperous
and permanent in pride and sin. The result has been overwhelming. Empire after
empire has fallen to the ground. I have passed over the ruins of dead and buried kingdoms; have
seen the shades of departed monarchies, and conversed with them, haunting the spots of their former
glory; and the hollow voice, as if the wind were moaning from earth's central sepulchres,
has spoken in the words of Scripture, deep unto deep, in my hearing, <span class="smcap">The nation and kingdom
that will not serve Thee shall perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted!</span>
It is a solemn thing to stand in the Colosseum at Rome, beneath the shadow of the Parthenon at
Athens, within the crumbling shrine of the temple of Karnak in Egypt, and to listen to the echo of
those awful words. These historical materials and monuments are so many intelligent chords,
which men's iniquities have wrought for that great harp of the past, across which God's Spirit
sweeps with its majestic, awful utterance! <span class="smcap">God</span> grant that the history of our nation may not add
another tone of wailing to the melancholy voices of dead empires!'</p></blockquote>


<p>We are glad to perceive that the '<cite>American Book Circular</cite>,' recently put forth by Mr. <span class="smcap">Geo. P. Putnam</span>,
of the Anglo-American house of <span class="smcap">Wiley and Putnam</span>, London, has been received with
a becoming spirit by the English press. It has been most favorably noticed in the 'London
Review,' 'Examiner,' 'Athenæum,' 'Literary Gazette,' and other influential journals; and its
publication has secured to the writer the attention and friendship of several of the most distinguished
literary and scientific gentlemen of the British metropolis. This timely pamphlet, in
fact, has opened the eyes of the English people to the progress of science and belles-lettres in
America, and has served to enlighten them as to the extent of their literary obligations to this
country. Widely noticed by the press, and stitched in all the principal reviews and periodicals of
England, the 'American Book-Circular' has already been productive of great good to the reputation
of our vigorous but infant 'republic of letters.' * * * '<span class="smcap">Flaneur</span>,' whom we welcome, has
made sundry inquiries in preceding pages concerning certain terms and sayings which have long
and generally obtained among pen-and-ink writers of romances and novels, native and foreign.
There are other common sayings and comparative-adages, toward one or two of which we
should be glad to direct the researches of the reader, 'on the present occasion.' 'Poor as <span class="smcap">Job's</span>
turkey,' has always puzzled us. Is there any authentic record of the personal condition of that
afflicted bird, or of the causes which threw it into a decline? Why has it been handed down
to us as the very <span class="smcap">Calvin Edson</span> of its tribe? 'Not worth a Tinker's d&mdash;n' is another adage,
whose origin is involved in mystery. When was the standard of value established for that intangible
commodity of this particular artizan? Was there ever a 'sliding scale' for it, or such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
thing as a 'first-quality' article in its kind, before it became a synonym for <em>nothing</em>? We have
already asked who that '<span class="smcap">Dick</span>' was, who wore such an 'odd hat-band' that its memorial has
been perpetuated even unto this day? 'We shall resume this important subject in our next discourse.'
* * * <span class="smcap">The</span> sudden death of <span class="smcap">William Abbott</span>, Esq., of the Park Theatre, has been
announced in nearly all the public journals of the United States. We had the pleasure to know
Mr. <span class="smcap">Abbott</span> well. He was first introduced to us, on his arrival in America, by a private letter
from Miss <span class="smcap">Landon</span>, who spoke of his literary and social qualities in terms of cordial admiration
and praise, which subsequent acquaintance convinced us were well deserved. To marked amenity
and cheerfulness of manner, Mr. <span class="smcap">Abbott</span> united literary acquirements of great extent and
variety; a thorough knowledge of society; and a frankness of deportment which won, and a sincerity
which retained, many friends. He was a most gentleman-like actor; and will be missed
and mourned not less by his professional brethren than by those whose acquaintance with his
talents and many good qualities was unconnected with his dramatic career. * * * <span class="smcap">How</span> very

<i>Boston, June, 1843.</i></p>

<p class="sig2">J. T. F.
</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> appearance on our table of an exquisitely beautiful card of invitation to the great <i>Dinner
at Faneuil Hall</i> on the Seventeenth of June (a kindness of the 'Committee of Arrangements,' for
which, although unfortunately adscititious, we desire to render our cordial acknowledgments)
reminds us to speak of <em>another</em> species of card, from the same press, which we must believe is
little known, but which only <em>requires</em> to be known, to be found in the possession of every tasteful
lover of the Beautiful. Mr. <span class="smcap">Dickinson</span>, of Boston, has recently completed a variety of ornamental
cards, of various sizes, large, medium, and <em>petite</em>, one use of which we desire to indicate to our
metropolitan readers; not without the hope also that the information will not come amiss to our
readers every where; for the cards are 'awaiting' as well as 'under <em>orders</em>.' As frames for
medium and small engravings, we certainly know of nothing so tasteful and so appropriate. In
color various; of tints inconceivably delicate; and with borderings of the most chaste yet elaborate
and distinct <i>bas-relief</i>; they are 'just the thing' for the purpose we have indicated. We shall
be happy to afford 'the ocular proof' to any one who may doubt the justice, or impugn the good
taste, which we conceive to characterize as well the cards as our encomiums! These admirable
specimens of American taste and skill may be found at the establishment of the Messrs. <span class="smcap">Woodworth</span>'s
(late <span class="smcap">Bonfanti</span>'s) and at <span class="smcap">Nesbitt</span>'s in this city. * * * <span class="smcap">The</span> interest still excited by the
slightest object connected with the name of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> has recently been curiously illustrated by
the opening of a '<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> Museum' in London, consisting of a vast collection of mementos of
the great hero and his associates, from the day of his birth to the time of his burial. Among them
is a morceau of his penmanship in his latter days, on the back of a card, the ominous nine of diamonds,
which has caused a good deal of merriment to the cockneys, although it strikes us they
should 'laugh on the wrong side of the mouth.' The imperial prisoner appears to have been
making an attempt to commit some English words to memory, and to have noted down the difference
between <em>hungry</em> and <em>angry</em>&mdash;words which must have sounded marvellously similar in his
ears, from the mouths of his English visitors: 'Are you 'ungry?&mdash;are you angry?' We do not
wonder at his perplexity. His memorandum runs thus upon the card: 'Are you 'ungry?'&mdash;'<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Avez
vous faim?</i>' '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Are you angry?</i>&mdash;'Etes vous en colere?' * * * '<i>Polemics</i>' is an article catholic
and cogent in spirit and argument, <em>but</em> it is <span class="smcap">TOO LONG</span> for an essay. (We wish we could impress
upon our didactic correspondents the necessity of at least <em>comparative</em> brevity!) Rev. <span class="smcap">Theodore
Parker</span>, in the following, has expressed every fact and argument which our correspondent has
expanded over eight letter-sheet pages! Indeed, himself shall be the judge:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Who</span> shall tell us that another age will not smile at our doctrines, disputes, and unchristian
quarrels about Christianity? Who shall tell us they will not weep at the folly of all such as fancied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Truth shone only in the contracted nook of their school, or sect, or coterie? Men of other times
may look down equally on the heresy-hunters and men hunted for heresy, and wonder at both.
The men of all ages before us were quite as confident as we, that their opinion was truth; that
their notion was Christianity, and the whole thereof. The men who lit the fires of persecution,
from the first martyr to Christian bigotry down to the last-murder of the innocents, had no doubt
their opinion was divine. No doubt an age shall come, in which ours shall be reckoned a period
of darkness, like the sixth century, when men groped for the wall, but stumbled and fell, because
they trusted a transient notion, not an eternal truth. But while this change goes on; while one
generation of opinions passes away and another rises up; Christianity itself, that pure religion,
which exists eternal in the constitution of the soul and the mind of <span class="smcap">God</span>, is always the same.'</p></blockquote>


<p>'<span class="smcap">Fancy's Vision</span>,' says a correspondent, in a running commentary upon the poetry of our May
number, 'is very well done for a Scotch song; although I think <span class="smcap">Burns</span> and others have too well
occupied that field, for foreign imitators to expect to glean much. It seems a little unnatural for
Americans to compose in the Scottish dialect, however simple and well-adapted to love-lyrics that
English-Doric may be thought. Some Scotticisms, such as 'bonnie,' 'burnie,' 'wimplin,' etc., are
very sweet; but others, in my view, such as 'hame,' 'drap,' etc., are inferior to the English.
Perhaps, however, the writer is a Caledonian.' To be sure she is; and 'that makes a difference;'
yet we do not disagree in the main with our correspondent. By the by, speaking of Scottish
poetry, here is a specimen of the true thing. It is from the pen of an esteemed friend and contributor,
and has been widely circulated, and as widely admired, both at home and abroad:</p>

<p>This would be 'ower Scotch,' perhaps, for an English ear, but that the very <em>sound</em> of the doubtful
words is expressive of their meaning. * * * <span class="smcap">The</span> '<cite>Reminiscence of Little Burke</cite>' is not to our
taste. He was an extraordinary urchin, certainly; but like all <em>very</em> precocious children, he grew
to&mdash;<em>nothing</em>. We have always utterly detested infant theatricals. We know of no more ridiculous
a sight than one of these dramatic juveniles 'strutting like a Lilliputian grenadier; trying to
knit its brow, and flourish its little falchion at an over-grown victim of its vengeance,' who is
bending half way down, to hear more distinctly the penny-trumpet tones in which he is threatened.
'Little <span class="smcap">Burke's</span>' father had no very exalted opinion of his son's genius! 'Oh, no! by no means!
oh, certainly not!' * * * <span class="smcap">We</span> cannot resist the employment of a line or two, though sadly pressed
for space, to commend to citizens and strangers the establishment of the <i>American Museum</i>, as
conducted by its present indefatigable proprietor. It was our intention to have particularized
some of the numerous attractions of this very popular resort; but as these are constantly changing,
our intelligence would be likely to prove '<span class="smcap">Johnny Thompson's</span> news' at the end of the
month in which we write. The corps of gentlemen-singers, for example, who adopted the
'Ethiopian' garb, were alone worth a walk of miles to hear. Think of a charming <em>duet</em>, in the
most perfect time and harmony, on a pair of tongs and an accordion! * * * <span class="smcap">We</span> derive from a
lady-friend, to whose kindness our readers have heretofore been indebted, the stanzas translated
from the German by <span class="smcap">Fitz Greene Halleck</span>, Esq., in preceding pages. They were withheld
originally from publication; the fastidious taste of the writer suggesting infelicities, which we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
certain will escape the scrutiny of less refined critics of 'the gentle art of song.' * * * <span class="smcap">Some</span>
newspaper 'down east' has been instigated to hint that the lively and gossipping New-York correspondence
of the Washington 'National Intelligencer' is written by <span class="smcap">John Neal</span>! As if it were
possible to mistake the pleasant style of Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>, for the labored yet slovenly <em>no-style</em> of
'<span class="smcap">Omnium Scriblerius</span>!' One might as well attribute the authorship of 'Thanatopsis' to 'Sir
<span class="smcap">William Marsh</span>, of Apple Island, Boston Harbor!' * * * <span class="smcap">The</span> paper elicited by the article upon
'<i>Forensic Eloquence</i>' in our last number, is somewhat too kindred in character with that excellent
performance, to be at present admissible. As the <span class="smcap">MS.</span> is left to our option, however, with permission
to 'add, clip, or destroy,' we annex a passage which will be new to many of our readers:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>, who was himself an accomplished orator, and knew all the windings of the art, was
so shaken on the occasion of <span class="smcap">Tully</span>'s oration, that he trembled, dropped his papers, and acquitted
the prisoner. Many attributed this to the force of <span class="smcap">Tully</span>'s elocution; but it seems rather to have
been the effect of <span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>'s art. He played back the orator's art upon himself. His concern was
feigned, and his mercy artificial; as he knew that nothing could so effectually win <span class="smcap">Tully</span> to his
party, as giving him the pride of having conquered <span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>.' In relation to the different <cite>styles</cite> of
eloquence, the same writer observes: 'The pathetic orator who throws a congregation of enthusiasts
into tears and groanings, would raise affections of a very different nature, should he attempt to
proselyte an American congress; and on the other hand, the finest speaker that ever commanded
the House, would in vain point the thunder of his eloquence on a Quaker meeting. <span class="smcap">Voltaire</span>
tells us, that 'in France a sermon is a long declamation, spoken with rapture and enthusiasm; in
Italy, it is a kind of devotional comedy; in England, it is a solid dissertation, sometimes a dry one,
which is read to the congregation without action or elocution.' A discourse which would raise
a French audience to the highest pitch of enthusiasm, would throw an English one into a fit of
laughter.'</p></blockquote>


<p>D.'s story of '<i>The Whistling Bridegroom</i>' is very good, but 'drawn too fine' for the strength of
the fabric. Briefly, it is this: A clergyman is uniting two persons in marriage; and when he
arrives at the point in the service where he directs the bridegroom to 'take the bride by the hand,'
the former pays no attention to him, but looks steadfastly upon the floor, and indulges in a subdued
whistle. The direction is repeated, but again the only notice taken of it is a continuation of the
whistling, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sotto voce</i>. A third time the <em>command</em> is given, and the only response is the unique
musical accompaniment aforesaid. The clergyman pauses, thinking himself intentionally insulted,
when the blushing bride, who had doubtless been thinking of other things, raised her eyes, saying:
'He's deaf, Sir; and it's his way to whistle to himself, when he's any thing on his mind!' The
explanation was satisfactory; and 'the deaf was <em>made</em> to hear' the next repetition of the important
direction. * * * '<span class="smcap">Pretty</span> good,' but not <em>quite</em> probable, we think, the wonderful '<i>Lusus
Naturæ</i>' described by our Kentucky correspondent! <em>Did</em> he really think we should nibble at that
hook? There is a wind-mill, we are informed, on the coast of Holland, which lays eggs and
breeds young ones; but its family is not near so remarkable as the Kentucky wonder of our new
contributor! Would he have the goodness to 'try again?' We fancy it must have been with
him that the western story of the '<i>Prock</i>' originated; a singular animal, with its legs, on one side
of its body, very short, to enable it to 'graze on the inclined planes of nature!' It was caught,
we remember, by 'heading it,' which reversed the animal, and rendered his legs useless, by
changing their position! <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive la Bagatelle!</i> * * * <span class="smcap">The</span> recent death of Hon. <span class="smcap">Hugh S. Legare</span> is
an event which deserves a particular record in these pages. He was one of the ripest scholars
of whom the Union could boast; and in all regards reflected high honor upon our literature. He
always wrote from a <em>full</em> mind. Let any one turn to the papers which he furnished for the
'Southern Review' and our own New-York Quarterly, and it will be seen how forcibly they
illustrate the justice of this encomium. Had Mr. <span class="smcap">Legare</span> lived, our readers would soon have had
an opportunity of admiring his literary performances in the pages of the <span class="smcap">Knickerbocker</span>. In a
late letter to the Editor, written only a few days previous to his leaving Washington for the last
time, Mr. <span class="smcap">Legare</span> incidentally exhibits the patient research of which he was about to reap an
adequate reward, in the new and high career of public service upon which he had entered. 'My
studies,' he writes, 'have for many years been of a very severe and serious cast, looking all of
them, more or less, to useful results in active life, and most of them connected with political economy
and jurisprudence.' Works of recondite research and striking views, such as those of
<span class="smcap">Niebur</span>, <span class="smcap">Savigny</span>, and others of that illustrious German line, had richly furnished his <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">adversaria</i>
and port-folios; and it was from these that he was to have enriched and diversified our pages.
The death of such a man, in the prime of life and in the midst of his usefulness, is a public loss,
which cannot fail to be widely and deeply felt. Honorable and high-minded in all the relations of
life, Mr. <span class="smcap">Legare</span> met his last hour with perfect composure. In dying as in living, he was the
admiration of his friends. * * * <span class="smcap">We</span> saw the other day what its possessor termed a '<em>Dogberry-o'-type</em>
likeness' of <span class="smcap">Miller</span>, the Prophet&mdash;a counterfeit presentment of a cunning old humbug, 'on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
its very <em>face</em>.' Its exhibition led to a story of one of <span class="smcap">Miller's</span> converts, which we thought worth
remembering. A matter-of-fact old gentleman in New England, whose wife was a thoroughgoing
'Destructionist,' was awakened out of his sleep by his 'possessed' rib, one cold and stormy
March night, with: 'Husband! did you hear that noise? It's <span class="smcap">Gabriel</span> a-comin'! It's the sound
of his chariot-wheels!' 'Oh, psha! you old fool!' replied the gude man; 'do you s'pose <span class="smcap">Gabriel</span>
is such an ass as to come <em>on wheels</em>, in such good sleighing as this? I tell you it's the wind; turn
over, and go to sleep!' We believe she did. * * * <span class="smcap">The</span> '<i>Confessions of a Belle</i>' is not a new title,
and it <em>strikes</em> us that we have encountered some of its incidents before. The <em>lesson</em>, howbeit, is an
excellent one. <span class="smcap">Theodore Hook</span> speaks forcibly to this point, in a portrait of one of his female
characters: 'With all this blaze of notoriety, did any body esteem her particularly? Was there
any <span class="smcap">one</span> man upon earth who on his pillow could say, 'My <span class="smcap">God</span>! what an angel is <span class="smcap">Fanny Wilding</span>!'
Had she ever refused an offer of marriage? No! for nobody ever had made her one.
She was like a fine fire-work, entertaining to look at, but dangerous to come near to; her bouncing
and cracking in the open air gave a lustre to surrounding objects, but there was not a human
being who could be tempted to take the exhibition into his own house.' * * * <span class="smcap">If</span> 'J. P. S.' will
look once more at our remarks, touching which he 'begs leave to demur,' he will find that we
differ very little from himself. His pride of opinion runs to a point, and reminds us of a reply we
once heard a quaint old Friend make to the eager question of a group around him, touching the
relative speed of two steam-boats which were running a race, and a very even one, through Long
Island Sound. 'Don't you think we've gained on her, in coming the last forty miles?' 'Yes,'
replied the Quaker, with great gravity; 'I should say we <em>had</em>.' 'Well, how <em>much</em>, should you
think?' 'I maybe mistaken,' responded our Friend, 'but, I should say, <em>about an inch</em>!' We
believe this 'close observer' was not again appealed to for his judgment in the premises. * * * <span class="smcap">We</span>
do not much affect parodies, generally, but the following, from the London '<i>Charivari</i>,' is too
good to be lost. It is entitled '<i>The Macadamized</i>,' and is set to the air of 'The Monks of Old:'</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<span class="smcap">Many</span> have told of the roads of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What a swamp of muck they were:<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Would make a street sweeper swear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For it goes beyond the Slough of Despond,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In its hopeless state of slush:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it grows, ha! ha! to your clothes, ha! ha!<br /></span>

</div></div>


<p>'<i>The Croton Fever</i>,' by '<span class="smcap">Straws, Jr.</span>' has good points. Some of its humor is 'rather <em>fine</em>,' certainly,
but only because it is <em>strained</em>. The satire, however, is in one instance just. A friend in
a sister city, recently returned home from a visit to New-York, writes us that he is henceforth a
Baptist, greatly preferring <em>immersion</em> to <em>sprinkling</em>, of which latter practice of ours, he entertains a
vivid recollection. 'In short,' he writes, 'I never saw such a set of incorrigible <em>squirts</em> as you
have in Gotham. Morning and evening, every householder, who can afford it, stands before his
door, playing with his machine; now deluging the walk, now the pavement, and anon flooding
his doors, windows, and blinds with hissing streams of Croton. When you write <span class="smcap">Dickens</span> next,
just tell him that the application of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">douche</i> to the pigs, from hundreds of Croton-pipers, has
well-nigh driven those quadrupedal republicans from the thoroughfares. That's <em>one</em> comfort!' Ah!
yes; and clean streets, and murmuring fountains, and cool side-walks, are 'comforts' also,
'which they of the adverse faction want.' The grapes are not <em>sweet</em>, and 'that's the humor
on't!' * * * <span class="smcap">The</span> Idleberg 'chronicle' will be concluded in our next. The loss of a sheet of the
copy (which has now been re-supplied by the author) is the cause of the delay. The fourth number
of 'Meadow Farm' will also appear in our August number. The following papers are filed
for insertion, or awaiting adequate consideration: 'Greek Epitaphs and Inscriptions;' 'The
Doomed Ship;' 'Thales of Paris;' 'Chronicles by an Antiquary;' 'My Leg, a Sketch;' 'A
Defence of the Pythagorean System;' 'The Novel-Reader;' 'Disguised Derivative Words in
English;' '<span class="smcap">Mary May</span>, the Newfoundland Indian;' 'An Old Man's Reminiscence;' 'Polygon
Papers,' Number Ten; 'The Birth-Day,' by 'W. C.;' 'New Version of an Old Fable;' 'The
Count of Paris;' 'The Painted Rock;' 'The Hour of Rest;' 'Sing,' by Lady <span class="smcap">Alicia Jane
Sparrow</span>, Ireland; 'Orators and Bells;' 'The Maiden's Burial,' etc. 'The Consumptive' is
both labored and common-place. 'Neanias' of Kentucky is not deemed admissible. * * * <span class="smcap">Several</span>
publications, among them a Lecture by <span class="smcap">Eugenius A. Nisbet</span>, delivered before the Georgia
Historical Society at Savannah, in March last; 'A Voice from the Vintage,' by Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ellis</span>, etc.,
will receive attention in our next. Our Philadelphia Friend, in reply to 'N. S. D.,' shall have a
place in the August number.</p>

<h2><a name="LITERARY_RECORD" id="LITERARY_RECORD">LITERARY RECORD.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Late Publications of the Brothers Harper.</span>&mdash;Independent of the serial works of the
<span class="smcap">Harper</span>'s, their <span class="smcap">Alison, Brande</span>'s Encyclopedia, etc., which they continue to publish with their
wonted regularity, and in their accustomed style of excellence, we have before us, in a large and
well-executed volume, 'A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities,' illustrated by numerous
engravings on wood, and containing numerous additional articles relative to the botany, mineralogy,
and zoology of the ancients; by <span class="smcap">Charles Anthon</span>, Esq., the American editor; a work of
too comprehensive a scope and of too great value to be despatched in so brief a notice as the
present; and <span class="smcap">M'Culloch</span>'s 'Universal Gazetteer, or Dictionary,' geographical, statistical, and
historical, of the various countries, places, and principal natural objects in the world, illustrated
by seven extensive and complete maps on steel.' Each article is written with fulness; the
arrangement is concise and clear; and the work may be referred to on the instant for any subject
embraced in its pages. We should be more indebted to the editor of the American department if
he would give us his valuable <em>facts</em> unconnected with his <em>opinions</em>. His sneer at the voyages of
discovery in the north-west, in connection with his reference to a ship-canal across the isthmus of
Darien, is in bad taste, to say the least of it. Narrow views in relation to great public enterprises
which may chance to be unsuccessful, are out of place in a noble work like this of <span class="smcap">M'Culloch</span>,
even though they appear in the 'questionable shape' of acknowledged annotation.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Cobb's Juvenile Readers.</span>&mdash;Mr. <span class="smcap">Lyman Cobb</span> deserves well of his country, and especially
of its juvenile citizens, for the several excellent school-books for the young which he has prepared
with great industry and tact, and from time to time put forth. We find on our table his three progressive
'Juvenile Readers;' and judging from the necessarily cursory examination which we
have been enabled to give them, we have no hesitation in pronouncing them the best works of
their class we have ever encountered. The author has taken great pains so to arrange the different
lessons as to lead the child by a regular gradation from easy to difficult reading; to adapt the
subjects to his advancement; and to place before him such matter, and such only, as shall convey to
the juvenile mind correct views, and just principles of morality. All words of variable or
doubtful orthography are also carefully exhibited. There are numerous other important merits,
and improvements upon kindred works, to which we have neither time nor space at present to
allude, but which we hope our readers will take occasion to find and admire in the works themselves.
Mr. <span class="smcap">Caleb Bartlett</span>, corner of Platt and Pearl-streets, is the New-York publisher of
Mr. <span class="smcap">Cobb</span>'s series.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">New Music</span>: '<span class="smcap">The Forsaken.</span>'&mdash;Mr. J. L. <span class="smcap">Hewitt</span>, 239 Broadway, has sent us '<i>The Forsaken</i>,'
a song sung with effect by Mr. <span class="smcap">Sinclair</span>, and written and <em>composed</em> by <span class="smcap">James Lawson</span>,
Esq. The 'words' were originally furnished to the <span class="smcap">Knickerbocker</span> by their author, and were
thence transferred to many American journals with cordial commendations. The music is, we
think, of a highly pleasing character; and we are not surprised to learn that the 'Song' is in very
general request. It is not given to <em>every</em> clever man, we can tell our friend and correspondent, to
excel both in poetical and musical composition, as himself has done in the instance before us.
We know, for example, a poet 'of the first water' who failed, on a memorable evening not long
ago, in improvising a solo for a jews'-harp, 'then and there being' in the hands of a legal friend,
who was making the little instrument 'discourse most eloquent music' It was <em>rather</em> a rich scene
than otherwise.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Agricultural Prize Essays.</span>&mdash;A well-printed pamphlet of an hundred and forty pages lies
before us, containing an 'Essay on the Preparation and Use of Manures,' and on 'Farm Management,'
by <span class="smcap">Willis Gaylord</span>, Esq., editor of 'The Cultivator,' one of the most widely circulated
journals in the United States. The first essay is an elaborate consideration of the laws of nutrition;
the preparation and distribution of animal, vegetable, and mineral manures; and the second
is a well-digested compend of all the various kinds of information and directions necessary to the
successful management of a farm. The useful pamphlet concludes with essays upon plans for
farm-houses and out-buildings, (illustrated by several clearly-engraved wood-cuts,) by Mr. <span class="smcap">John
J. Thomas</span>, Macedon, New-York, Mr. G. D. <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>, Salem, Conn., and Mr. T. M. <span class="smcap">Niven</span>,
Newburgh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Battle of Bunker-Hill.</span>&mdash;The small but very comprehensive volume recently put forth by
Mr. C. P. <span class="smcap">Emmons</span>, of Charlestown, (Mass.,) containing 'Sketches of Bunker-Hill Battle and
Monument, with Illustrative Documents,' should be in the hands of every American, who desires
a record of this most important battle of the Revolution. In the preliminary remarks on the opening
of the struggle, and the description of the great battle itself, there is nothing included that is
irrelevant, while every thing is embraced that could add to the truth or force of the picture.
The illustrative documents are of very great interest. On the English side, we have extracts
from General <span class="smcap">Howe's</span> orderly-book, letters from Generals <span class="smcap">Gage</span> and <span class="smcap">Burgoyne</span>, and several
other British officers, together with divers grumbling extracts from the English newspapers, touching
the result of the 'victory.' On the American side, we have the proceedings of the Committee
of Safety, the accounts sent to England and to Congress, with descriptive letters from Colonel
<span class="smcap">Stark</span>, Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaac Lothrop</span>, and Rev. Dr. <span class="smcap">Elliot</span>. An account of the inception, progress, and
final completion of the Monument, accompanied by a sectional engraving of the structure, appropriately
closes the volume.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Froissart's Chronicles.</span>&mdash;Who that has ever read the stirring Chronicles of Sir <span class="smcap">John Froissart</span>,
but will rejoice to learn that an excellent edition of them, upon a new and clear type, and
with all the original engravings, is being issued in numbers from the office of the New World?
We have never found such a historian as Sir <span class="smcap">John</span>. Give him a battle to describe, a hero worthy
of his pen to hand down to posterity, and what a love of his theme, what <em>personal</em> enthusiasm,
does he throw into his glowing records! We have sometimes thought that our worthy and world-renowned
progenitor, <span class="smcap">Diedrich Knickerbocker</span>, of blessed memory, derived no small portion
of his fervent historical style from a familiar study of his great predecessor. Be that, however,
(and every thing else,) as it may, here are the glorious 'Chronicles' of Sir <span class="smcap">John Froissart</span>, accessible
to all, for a comparative trifle; and the more who embrace this occasion to read them, the
fewer stupid people will there be in the country&mdash;in our humble opinion.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Port-Chester Seminary.</span>&mdash;This boarding school for young ladies and gentlemen is in Westchester
county, in a beautiful situation, and of easy access from the city. It has now for its
Principal, <span class="smcap">Rufus H. Bacon</span>, A. B., a fine scholar, and well skilled in the discharge of his important
trusts. The design of the Principal and his subordinate teachers is, to impart a full and
thorough knowledge of the branches of a good English education; to fit young men for college
and the counting-room; and to prepare the pupils for honor and usefulness, by softening their
manners and improving their moral perceptions. Kindness and attention to their neatness,
health, and comfort, are not lost sight of. The terms are low, though the references are very high,
being all 'O. F. M.'&mdash;'our first men.'</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Boston 'Christian World.'</span>&mdash;We have looked through several numbers of this very
various and well-supplied weekly journal, with invariable and increasing interest. It is edited,
as we learn, by <span class="smcap">George G. Channing</span>, a brother of the late lamented Dr. <span class="smcap">Channing</span>, assisted
by a number of Unitarian clergymen, and is widely sustained throughout the United States
by the patronage and contributions of the members of that religious denomination. It is beautifully
printed with a large, clear type, upon paper of a fine color and texture. The mechanical
department is in the hands of an artist in his profession, to whose good taste and careful
supervision this Magazine has heretofore been much indebted, and for which it here renders its
acknowledgments.</p>


<p>'<span class="smcap">New Pictorial Bible.</span>'&mdash;The Messrs. <span class="smcap">Harper</span> may well pronounce this 'the most splendid
and richly-illustrated Bible ever published in the world.' It is to be issued on the cheap plan, in
numbers, on foolscap folio sized paper, and will be embellished with <em>sixteen hundred</em> historical
engravings, more than fourteen hundred of which are from original designs by <span class="smcap">Chapman</span>, made
expressly for the work, and executed in the most finished manner, at an expense of over twenty-five
thousand dollars! Those who subscribe early will have the advantage of proof impressions.</p>

<p>&#9758; A <span class="smcap">notice</span> of 'Classical Studies, or Essays on Ancient Literature,' 'The Karen Apostle,'
and 'The New Purchase,' were in type for the present number, and will appear in our issue for
August.</p>
